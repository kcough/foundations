    "## Supreme Court Project Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this project is to build a database of Supreme Court cases for 2016 that includes the dialogue from the oral arguments of each case. As we have seen in class the arguments were scraped from this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx \n",
    "\n",
    "I have already downloaded and transformed the PDFs of the transcripts into text documents which you can download from courseworks: supreme_court_pdfs_txt.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps that you need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** Step 3 is the most challenging--if you want to spend some time coding, you can skip Steps 1 and 2 and get to work on Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 1:** scrape all of the case information available on this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx \n",
    "\n",
    "This should include case name, docket number, etc--and most importantly the name of the PDF file. All of the text files share the exact same name as the PDF files they came from. This file name will allow you to connect your transcription data with your case data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to you what kind Data structure you want to build. But it likely to be a list of lists, or list of dictionaries--for each case you will have a list or dictionary of the information you scrape from the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 2:** find a secondary source to scrape/integrate with your case data. The information on the Supreme Court page is very limited. You need to find a source or group of sources that ad information. The most important information would likely be: the decision, who voted for and against, and the state of origin of the case (for geocoding). You might think of other great things to put in there too! This information needs to be merged with the data you have from STEP 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 3:** use regular expressions to clean up and parse the text files so that you have a searchable data structure containing the dialog from the transcripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a data architecture perspective, you probably want to have a separate list for each case and in each list a data structure that pairs the speaker with what she/he says. Like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[['MR. BERGERON',\" Yes. That's essentially the same thing\"],[ 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR',' So how do you deal with Chambers?']]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list of lists --it could also be a list of dictionaries if you want it to be. The real programmatic challenge here is to clean up the text files and parse them successfully. Most of the instructions below are devoted to this, but Steps 1 and 2 are also extremely important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go step-by-step through this, and email me whenever you get stuck, and I will help. If you complete all the steps before Tuesday, email me if you want to go further.\n",

Apple, Incorporated. 6 Ms. Sullivan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 A smartphone is smart because it contains 12 hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it 13 work. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of 14 the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design 15 patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to 16 total profit on the entire phone. 17 That result makes no sense. A single design 18 patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone 19 should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the 20 profit on the entire phone. 21 Section 289 does not require that result, 22 and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, 23 Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does 24 not require that result. We respectfully ask that the 25 Court hold that when a design patent claims a design\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n4 1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a component 2 of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, 3 when a design patent is applied to an article of 4 manufacture within a multi-article product, we request 5 that you hold that Section 289 entitles the 6 patent-holder to total profit on the article of 7 manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and 8 not the profits on the total product. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how to 10 instruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not the 11 government, both parties kind of leave it up and say, 12 oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simply 13 wouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test. 14 My preference, if -- if I were just making 15 another sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies to 16 see how the -- the extent to which the design affected 17 the consumer, and then the jury would have something to 18 do that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlong 19 into the statute. 20 You can\\'t really have apportionment, so it 21 seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to 22 have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example 23 that\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is 24 a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and 25 just follow the words of the statute. But it seems to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s one\\n\\n4 thing to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --\\n\\n5 if I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do under\\n\\n6 your brief.\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not propose\\n\\n8 a test that simply leaves it to the jury without\\n\\n9 guidance. The instruction we proposed and that was\\n\\n10 rejected by the district court appears in the blue brief\\n\\n11 at page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that\\n\\n12 the article of manufacture to which a design has been\\n\\n13 applied is the part or portion of the product as sold\\n\\n14 that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the\\n\\n15 patent.\\n\\n16 So, Justice Kennedy, our test is very\\n\\n17 simple.\\n\\n18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I just\\n\\n19 don\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the jury\\n\\n20 room; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.\\n\\n21 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what we\\n\\n22 respectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the\\n\\n23 test for what constitutes an article of manufacture.\\n\\n24 And to be clear, I\\'m now stressing our\\n\\n25 article-of-manufacture argument, not the causation\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 argument we gave as an alternative.\\n\\n6\\n\\n2 As the case comes to the Court, all we ask\\n\\n3 is that you rule in favor of us on article of\\n\\n4 manufacture.\\n\\n5 And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us\\n\\n6 what to look at --\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly make\\n\\n8 sure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --\\n\\n9 you\\'re saying we should only look to what an article of\\n\\n10 manufacture is and not your other argument that there\\n\\n11 should be apportionment as to any particular article of\\n\\n12 manufacture.\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n14 We\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the\\n\\n15 case, that a jury should be instructed that total profit\\n\\n16 must be profit derived from the article of manufacture\\n\\n17 to which the design has been applied.\\n\\n18 And, Your Honor, the statute does support\\n\\n19 our test because the statute asks us to look at the\\n\\n20 article of manufacture to which the design has been\\n\\n21 applied.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that in\\n\\n23 this -- in this case?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case it\\n\\n25 is -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n7 1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-cornered 2 front face of a phone. 3 In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular, 4 round-cornered front face of the phone with certain 5 aspect ratio and corner radii. 6 In the D\\'305, it is the display screen on 7 which the graphical user interface appears. 8 So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question, 9 the jury should have been instructed either with our 10 instruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to the 11 jury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article of 12 manufacture here, but it may be less than the entire 13 phone. The article of manufacture may be a part or 14 portion of the phone, and you should look at two things, 15 Your Honor. 16 You should look at the patent, and, Justice 17 Kennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look at 18 the -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought to 19 look at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patent 20 is going to be the best guide to what the design is 21 applied to in many, many cases, as in this case. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seem 23 to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of 24 law, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matter 25 of law.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n8 1 I believe that your basic argument, everyone 2 is in agreement, that the test is an article of 3 manufacture for purposes of sale. 4 But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how 5 do we announce the right test for that? Because the 6 phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer 7 as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. That 8 might be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know. 9 Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how to 10 figure out the component part. I don\\'t know where in 11 the record you would have enough to survive your 12 argument. 13 MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me back 14 up and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence. 15 The -- the test -- and I want to agree with 16 Your Honor. To be clear, we say that what the Federal 17 Circuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrong 18 as a matter of law to hold that the entire product is 19 necessarily the article of manufacture from which you 20 measure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law, 21 but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has to 22 hold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law. 23 It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question of 24 either fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrel 25 question of law and fact.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n9 1 And why does it involve both? Because we 2 know that district courts look at patents. You assign 3 them that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. And 4 when they look at a patent for a claim construction, 5 we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar. 6 The district court can look at the patent 7 and say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. This 8 isn\\'t one of Apple\\'s 13 other patents on other parts of 9 the phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of the 10 entire case. This is the front face patent. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how would 12 you determine the profit attributable to the relevant 13 article of manufacture? 14 MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor. 15 First, through ordinary accounting that 16 would look to the cost of goods sold in relation to 17 revenues for the relevant component. 18 You could look, if -- if a company buys the 19 component from an original equipment manufacturer, you 20 would look to their profit margins and apply that. 21 If, as sometimes happens within a company, 22 one division makes the glass front face and another 23 division makes the innards of the phone, you would find 24 out the transfer pricing between the divisions. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n10 1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent on 2 the inner parts and a hundred million was spent on the 3 face, then it\\'s a 10:1 ratio. 4 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, Your 5 Honor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have expert 7 testimony on all of that. 8 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would. 9 And you would -- but that\\'s just one way. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you had 11 a case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some of 14 the briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle 15 design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of 16 genius and it identified the car. Then it seems to me 17 that that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give three 18 days\\' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop 19 the motor. 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s what 21 we would do with the Beetle. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- it 23 seems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing. 24 MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. To 25 answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n11 1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the 2 total profit from the relevant article of manufactures 3 here, the front face, or the display screen.

One could have been consumer 5 demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested. 6 Apple could have said well, people really like the front 7 face disproportionately to all the other parts of the 8 phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence 9 to prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence or 10 indirect evidence through consumer survey. But, Your 11 Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total 12 profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be 13 a substantial part of the total profit on the product. 14 Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool, 15 shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. 16 It may be that the article of manufacture to which the 17 design patent is applied is just the exterior body of 18 the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay 19 much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle. 20 They want to pay for the cool way it looks. 21 If that\\'s so, it should be open to the 22 patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come 23 from the exterior of the car. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference in 25 practical terms between that and your causation argument\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 or apportionment?\\n\\n12\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concede\\n\\n5 under article of manufacture that the holder of the\\n\\n6 patent gets profit from the article, even if the profit\\n\\n7 does not come entirely from the design.\\n\\n8 Let me give you an example with a phone\\'s\\n\\n9 front face. Consumers may value the front face because\\n\\n10 it\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,\\n\\n11 because it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give the\\n\\n12 patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all\\n\\n13 the profits for the front face, even if it includes\\n\\n14 profit from those non-design features of the front face,\\n\\n15 where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test\\n\\n16 would limit the profits to the profits from the design\\n\\n17 parts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,\\n\\n18 that\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting a\\n\\n19 little more with article of manufacture than we do with\\n\\n20 a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy\\n\\n21 for that.\\n\\n22 But the reason we think it\\'s consistent with\\n\\n23 Congress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress\\n\\n24 was trying to do was provide a rule that gives\\n\\n25 design-patent holders total profit from the article of\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 manufacture.\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 That\\'s a little bit overinclusive, because\\n\\n3 if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue\\n\\n4 in the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from the\\n\\n5 design, and there will be a little extra you\\'re getting\\n\\n6 perhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress\\n\\n7 was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say\\n\\n8 that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say\\n\\n9 that design causes value in a single article product\\n\\n10 like a rug.\\n\\n11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at this\\n\\n12 record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole\\n\\n13 phone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, they\\n\\n14 were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --\\n\\n15 this was their argument to the jury and it sold the\\n\\n16 Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,\\n\\n17 that, you know, all smartphones basically function the\\n\\n18 same. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.\\n\\n19 This is what they were arguing, and they put on an\\n\\n20 expert that gave total profits. If the jury credited\\n\\n21 them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a\\n\\n22 properly instructed jury, could you overturn that\\n\\n23 finding?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back to\\n\\n25 the proper instruction. The jury was not properly\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 instructed here.\\n\\n14\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,\\n\\n3 Miss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. If\\n\\n5 the article of manufacture was the entire ornamental\\n\\n6 appearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on\\n\\n7 the entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assert\\n\\n8 it here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone\\n\\n9 does not look substantially similar to the entire\\n\\n10 outside of a Samsung phone. The reason why design\\n\\n11 patencies carve the product up into multiple partial\\n\\n12 design claims is so they can make a narrow infringement\\n\\n13 argument and find a little sliver of the phone on which\\n\\n14 infringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate to\\n\\n15 give total profit when they do that.\\n\\n16 So, Your Honor, if there had been a design\\n\\n17 patent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple\\n\\n18 could have tried to get total profit on the entire case.\\n\\n19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\\n\\n20 \"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properly\\n\\n21 instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case\\n\\n22 could not have found for Apple. Is that what --\\n\\n23 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n24 That is very much our position.\\n\\n25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the jury\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 instruction, what was the legal error?\\n\\n15\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in the\\n\\n3 jury instruction --\\n\\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides a\\n\\n5 properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor\\n\\n6 of Apple on the evidence presented?\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,\\n\\n8 because --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides the\\n\\n10 jury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a proper\\n\\n11 instruction was given -- what would have been the legal\\n\\n12 error?\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- no\\n\\n14 reasonable jury could have found on this record that the\\n\\n15 entire product was the article of manufacture to which\\n\\n16 the design has been applied. Two reasons.\\n\\n17 One, design patents cover ornamental\\n\\n18 appearance. They cannot, by definition, cover the\\n\\n19 innards of the phone. So the functional innards of the\\n\\n20 phone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design\\n\\n21 patent.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claim\\n\\n23 the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover the\\n\\n24 innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find\\n\\n25 its -- could find that the consumers and others would\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n16 1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks 2 only. 3 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talking 4 about design patents, not trademark or copyright. 5 There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here on 6 the -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree with 8 you, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answer 10 your question as precisely as I can. Just because you 11 can show that most of the profit comes from the Beetle 12 exterior does not mean the car is the article of 13 manufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test. 14 First, determine what is the article of 15 manufacture. 16 Then second step, determine the quantum of 17 damages, quantum of profits in this case, from that 18 article. 19 Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almost 20 all its profits from the exterior case, people were 21 indifferent to whether they could read their e-mail, 22 navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If you 23 could prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'t 24 happen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvette 25 or the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n17 1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion of 2 the total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at the 4 trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article 5 less than the whole phone? 6 MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. And 7 we were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the jury 8 instruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began, 9 we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket 1322. We said 10 very clearly article of manufacture is less than the 11 total phone and profit should be limited to the profit 12 from the article. We said again in the jury 13 instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully 14 to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on 15 petition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to the 16 court and we said please listen to us about article of 17 manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the 18 article. The district court said, no, I already said no 19 apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no 20 apportionment, she shut us out of both theories. The 21 district court shut us out of article of manufacture as 22 the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of 23 causation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here. 24 So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, our 25 charge conference. And then again in our 50A and the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n18 1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again 2 said article is separate from apportionment, and the 3 article here is less than the phone. At 197 we said 4 at -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is less 5 than the phone. And in the 50B at the close of the 6 first trial, we again said article is less than the 7 phone. 8 Second trial happens on certain phones. 9 Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says 10 again, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment for 11 design patents. You cannot talk to me about article of 12 manufacture. We tried over and over and over again to 13 get the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and we 14 were rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor? 15 Because there was evidence in the case from which a 16 reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found 17 that the components were the front face, the front face, 18 and the display screen. And the evidence came out of 19 Apple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled to 20 rely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again and 21 again said what are you claiming. And when the 22 witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'t 23 say the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'re 24 claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, 25 ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n19 1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore 2 everything that\\'s outside the dotted lines. 3 And if I could just remind you that we\\'ve 4 reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look 5 like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D\\'677. They may 6 look like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was in 7 Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. 8 The claim is for the small portion of the external 9 appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. 10 Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. It 11 disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. 12 And Your Honor, the question for the jury 13 was not did people think that the look and feel of an 14 iPhone was great. The question for the jury was did the 15 very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes 16 look substantially similar to the very small portion of 17 the patent claim? 18 Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in 19 this record for a conclusion that the entire product, 20 profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit 21 from those articles. What Apple should have done is 22 done either of the two things we discussed earlier, 23 accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goods 24 sold on the components, or it should have done consumer 25 survey evidence like our expert did.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n20 1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General has 2 proposed a test with four factors to determine the 3 article question. Do you agree with those? Are there 4 others you would add? 5 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answer 6 briefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time. 7 We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test. 8 We propose a briefer test that we think is more 9 administrable. We propose that you look to two factors: 10 The design in the patent and the accused product. We 11 think our test is more administrable, and it can often 12 be done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do in 13 Markman, who will then instruct the jury and give them 14 guidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further on 15 rebuttal. Thank you very much. 16 I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time, 17 Mr. Chief Justice. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 Mr. Fletcher. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER 21 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 22 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 24 and may it please the Court: 25 This case presents two related questions\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 about the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for\\n\\n21\\n\\n2 design-patent infringement under Section 289. If I\\n\\n3 understood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentation\\n\\n4 correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both\\n\\n5 of those legal questions.\\n\\n6 Just to summarize briefly, first, the court\\n\\n7 of appeals correctly held that Section 289\\'s provision\\n\\n8 for an award of total profits means that the\\n\\n9 patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the\\n\\n10 sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not\\n\\n11 just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder\\n\\n12 can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as\\n\\n13 opposed to other features of the article.\\n\\n14 But second, we read the court of appeals\\'\\n\\n15 opinion to have held that the relevant article of\\n\\n16 manufacture for which profits are owed is always the\\n\\n17 entire product that the infringer sells to customers.\\n\\n18 And we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand all\\n\\n19 parties to agree with that now.\\n\\n20 Instead, the relevant article of manufacture\\n\\n21 to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes\\n\\n22 be a part or a component of a larger product sold in\\n\\n23 commerce. And when that is the case, all parties now\\n\\n24 agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the\\n\\n25 profits from that infringing article and not to all --\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n22 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when the 2 component -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t sold 3 apart from the entire product, how should the -- the 4 judge charge the jury on determining the profit 5 attributable to the infringing article? 6 MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d be 7 two factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed. 8 The first one would be what is the relevant article, and 9 there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case. 10 The second question, once the fact-finder 11 identifies the relevant article, is the question that 12 you asked, which is how much of the total profits from 13 the device are attributable to the infringing article? 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step, 15 and how do you figure it out? 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he complete 17 his answer to my question? 18 MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on the 19 second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a 20 lot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in this 21 case. This case sort of stopped at the first step. But 22 we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that 23 courts have handled other analogous questions, and I 24 point to two areas of law where that\\'s happened. 25 The first is utility patent damages under\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n23 1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the 2 infringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often a 3 patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in 4 commerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitled 5 to the profits that are attributable to the infringing 6 part, but not the whole machine. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- Justice 8 Ginsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her, 9 adequately summarized, the test that you propose at 10 page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include? 11 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test we 12 propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions 13 that I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article of 14 manufacture to which the design has been applied? Once 15 the fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the test 16 that we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to be 17 Justice Sotomayor\\'s question. 18 I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking 19 once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article 20 is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on 21 the car, how do they separate out the part of the 22 profits that are attributable to that component from the 23 whole. 24 And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefed 25 it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n24 1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that 2 courts have confronted in other areas of law. One was 3 utility patent damages, as I described. Another one is 4 discussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in the 5 Sheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a case 6 where the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses be 8 called on in order to show part one or part two or both? 9 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very often 10 both. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would those 12 expert witnesses -- who would they be? What would they 13 say? 14 MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will depend 15 on -- on the circumstances of the case. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case. 17 MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someone 18 familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in 19 the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone 20 company, or someone who is familiar with the market for 21 smartphones and who could speak to on the first question 22 how smartphones are put together, how they are 23 manufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extent 24 to which the components of a smartphone are separable. 25 And then on the second question, the one\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n25 1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be 3 speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in 4 your question in the Sullivan, which is things like 5 consumer surveys, to what extent do the various 6 components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and 7 contribute to the value of the phone. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the 9 things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. I 10 don\\'t understand how that helps on this question. It 11 would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it 12 contributed to profits. 13 MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits from 16 the bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each of 17 these components, and then what share of the revenue is 18 attributable to each of these components. And then you 19 say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up 21 calculation and try to do it that way. 22 Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimes 23 that won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation and 25 said the total profits on this product are $10 million,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n26 1 and we think that the component at issue here, based on 2 expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 3 25 percent. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said based 5 on expert testimony. What would -- what would they be 6 talking about? 7 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldon 8 case that\\'s cited on page 27 of our brief from this 9 Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these 10 problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion 11 the portion -- the profits from a movie that are 12 attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or 13 the directors or other things. And they had experts who 14 were familiar with the industry and who said the script 15 is important but, really, a lot of the value and 16 particularly for a movie like this comes from other 17 things. 18 And there were various expert testimonies 19 that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up 20 saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of 21 the total profits from the movie, and this Court 22 affirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonable 23 approximation. 24 We\\'re not -- never going to be able to get 25 to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable\\n\\n27\\n\\n2 approximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly better\\n\\n3 than awarding all or nothing. And courts have been able\\n\\n4 to come to those reasonable approximations by using\\n\\n5 expert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'ve\\n\\n6 discussed.\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could you\\n\\n8 speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I\\n\\n9 understand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, that\\n\\n10 distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'s\\n\\n11 just -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body of\\n\\n12 the car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a real\\n\\n13 question as to whether it is being -- the design is\\n\\n14 being applied to the car itself.\\n\\n15 So how would you go about thinking about\\n\\n16 that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and\\n\\n17 under what instructions?\\n\\n18 MR. FLETCHER: So we think the basic\\n\\n19 question for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article of\\n\\n20 manufacture to which the design has been applied. We\\n\\n21 think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'s\\n\\n22 observation in Gorham. It\\'s 1871, first design patent\\n\\n23 case that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thing\\n\\n24 that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of\\n\\n25 manufacture.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n28 1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bug 2 example is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be very 3 easy. If the patented design is for a refrigerator 4 latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the 5 distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk about 7 the hard cases. 8 MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases, 9 like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s either 10 the body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court four 11 factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the 12 jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those 13 factors. And so we say you should compare the scope of 14 the patented design as shown in the drawings in the 15 patent, how prominently that design features in the 16 accused article, whether there are other conceptually 17 distinct innovations or components in the article that 18 are not part of or associated with the patented design, 19 and finally the physical relationship between the 20 patented design and the rest of the article. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, how 22 would you decide the Beetle case, or what experts would 23 you want to hear? 24 MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- as 25 to the article, what\\'s the article --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n29 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given you 2 that second option. 3 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s a 4 factual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear from 5 experts who can speak to the question of how is the 6 Beetle put together, and what other parts of the -- the 7 Beetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetle 9 put together? It\\'s put together like every other car. 10 I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whether 11 the shape of the body is distinctive or not. 12 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also want 13 to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that 14 the scope of the claim design covers the whole article, 15 but not the interior of the car. There are design 16 features in the interior that the driver sees that 17 aren\\'t the body of the article. 18 As to the second factor, how prominent is 19 the design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts in 20 favor of finding that the design does cover the whole 21 article. 22 Then the third one is conceptually distinct 23 innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way. 24 There are going to be lots of other features of the car 25 or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 system, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you\\n\\n30\\n\\n2 might want to hear adverse testimony.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the first\\n\\n4 part of the test.\\n\\n5 MR. FLETCHER: Correct.\\n\\n6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article of\\n\\n7 manufacture.\\n\\n8 So now take the second part of the test and\\n\\n9 apply it to the Bug.\\n\\n10 MR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'ve\\n\\n11 decided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug\\n\\n12 is just the body of the Bug.\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\\n\\n14 MR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question is\\n\\n15 the best way to determine that, at least that I can\\n\\n16 think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed\\n\\n17 to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their\\n\\n18 purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and\\n\\n19 to what extent are they instead valuing other things\\n\\n20 like --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that that\\n\\n22 question is not relevant to the first question. In\\n\\n23 other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs\\n\\n24 buy them because of the look of the car.\\n\\n25 MR. FLETCHER: Yes.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n31 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'s 2 only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, 3 which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or the 4 whole car that the design is being applied to? 5 MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s the 6 statute -- the way the statute reads. It says you get 7 profits from the article of manufacture. And so, 8 logically, I think the way to approach it would be 9 identify the article and then let the patent-holder make 10 the argument that even though the article may be just a 11 part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s just 12 the case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sells 13 it. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder, 14 in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'s 15 selling the whole product, still recover a very 16 substantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is not 20 helpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought that 21 nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like 22 the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think, 23 $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What 24 if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? 25 What if it broke down every 50 miles?\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n32 1 So if that is a real question, if it is a 2 real question whether the article of manufacture there 3 is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about 4 the test for determining what is the article of 5 manufacture. 6 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that those 7 things can be taken into account at the second step of 8 the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the 9 relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car, 10 but for all of the reasons you just pointed out. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- you 12 were saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficult 13 question. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors to 14 determine what is the article of manufacture there. 15 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think if 16 you\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test for 17 article of manufacture also lets some of those 18 considerations play into that test, because it gets to 19 whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions, 20 or other components of the product unrelated to the 21 design. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n33 1 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 2 and may it please the Court: 3 Before I address the Court\\'s many questions 4 initiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jury 5 be instructed under what we and the government believe 6 to be the relevant question -- that is, the factual test 7 of whether the relevant article of manufacture is the 8 article as sold or a distinct component of it -- and I 9 think it\\'s very clear to address the questions that 10 Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, and 11 Ms. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened in 12 this case. 13 There is no -- whatever you determine the 14 right instruction should be, there is no basis to 15 overturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case. 16 There were two trials below. In neither 17 trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or 18 witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any 19 article of manufacture other than the phones themselves. 20 In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner, 21 calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones 22 themselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable juror 23 in these trials could possibly have awarded total 24 profits on anything other than the phones, unless this 25 Court holds --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n34 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because the 2 district judge limited them? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happened 4 was, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s a 5 pretrial statement that the parties have to file saying, 6 these are -- the phones are the -- the phones were 7 infringed. The phones are the things that were 8 infringed for purposes of sale, and here is what our 9 evidence is on total profits from the phone. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on this 11 point. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question 12 trying to figure out what the standard is. Now, why 13 can\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your 14 arguments and theirs, and work it out? 15 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not a 16 difficult -- the record in this case is not difficult. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'s 18 difficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'s 21 difficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side. 22 So if I go through and come to the 23 conclusion, at least, that each side has a good 24 argument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focus 25 on the question that is of great importance across\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n35 1 industries and leave the application of that and whether 2 it was properly raised to the lower courts? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this were 4 difficult, it would be entirely appropriate for this 5 Court simply to announce what the law is, which I think 6 there is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'re 7 not suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'t 8 necessary for the Court to do it. 9 This is a case very much like global tech, 10 when you found that the lower court had applied the 11 wrong standard for intentional infringement, and then 12 found that the record -- even -- but under the correct 13 higher standard, the record admitted no other 14 conclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that they 15 never identified to the jury, in either case, any 16 article of manufacture other than the phone. And all of 17 their evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based on 18 the total profits to the phone. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'ll 20 read it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question on 23 the general issue, which I think is tough. And the 24 general question that I have is I have been looking for 25 a standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n36 1 quite close; the parties actually in the government are 2 fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the 3 Internet Association, the software industry. And you 4 know that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and some 5 others. 6 MR. WAXMAN: I do. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did is 8 they went back into history. They have a lot of 9 different cases which they base the standard on, and 10 they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague, 11 but that the design where it\\'s been applied to only 12 part -- it\\'s on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product 13 and does not drive demand for the entire product, the 14 article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only 15 the component to which the design applies. And only 16 profit attributable to that component may be awarded. 17 Now, really, to understand it, you have to 18 have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to 19 understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use 20 examples. And so that kind of standard, with perhaps 21 examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper, 22 you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on the 23 hood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit from 24 the car. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n37 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not? 2 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand your 3 question, and I just want to bookmark the fact that I 4 have not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s 5 question. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead and 7 answer her question. At some point you can come back to 8 it. 9 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer Justice 10 Ginsburg first and then Justice Breyer. 11 Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that 12 Samsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened in 13 the Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report, 14 Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed to 15 present evidence about that -- about the value of design 16 to the total product as a whole. That was 17 apportionment, Judge Koh said. 18 He wanted -- he calculated total profits 19 based on the phone. And his report then said, well, but 20 I believe that only 1 percent of the value of the phone 21 is due to the design or the design of the iconic front 22 face of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him to 23 do because that was apportionment. 24 The question -- the only issue with respect 25 to article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n38 1 either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as a 2 matter of law in a multicomponent product, the article 3 of manufacture must be the portion. 4 They never said that to the jury. They did 5 propose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed the 6 jury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It also 7 directed the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'t 8 approve it. Now, it just so happens that they preserved 9 no relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'re 11 spending an awful lot of time on an issue about what was 12 raised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raised 13 below, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time to 14 turn to Justice Breyer\\'s question. 15 MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to do 16 that. 17 Justice Breyer, the -- there is no question 18 that in an appropriate case the jury can decide whether 19 the article of manufacture to which the design is 20 applied and to which it provides a distinctive and 21 pleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'s 22 actually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers, 23 or it could be a component of it. 24 In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'s 25 really not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n39 1 there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question of 2 fact for the jury. 3 We believe that the -- the four factors that 4 the Solicitor General articulated would be appropriate 5 factors to consider. 6 I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the 8 question of fact? 9 MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to which 11 the law applies? What -- what is the question of fact? 12 MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In a 13 case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing 14 articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should 15 be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find 16 infringement, total profits are awarded on the article 17 of manufacture to which the patented design was applied 18 for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar 19 or distinctive appearance. 20 You may determine that the article of 21 manufacture is the entire product or a distinct 22 component of that product. In making that 23 determination, you may consider, and this would depend 24 on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would 25 include the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n40 1 things. For example, most importantly the identity of 2 what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers. 3 Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers 4 to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 5 patentee\\'s product. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m not 7 grasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to me 8 that the design is applied to the exterior case of the 9 phone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips and 10 wires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And, 14 you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent on 15 something that the consumer can\\'t see. And yet 16 Congress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entire 19 price of the phone. 20 MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded on 21 the article of manufacture to which the design is 22 applied. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, the 24 case is part of it. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n41 1 think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s important 2 to understand that design is not a component and the 3 patented design is not the article of manufacture. The 4 patented design is something that\\'s applied to an 5 article of manufacture. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, 7 these -- these little, the chips and all are articles of 8 manufacture, right? How is the design of the case 9 applied to those chips? 10 MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, if 11 you look at, for example, in the early days, when the 12 patent -- when the design -- when design patents were 13 first permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 of 15 them were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines and 16 things like that. Congress -- when Congress said that 17 you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson 18 cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is 19 infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not 20 happen innocently. 21 When there is infringement of a design, the 22 patentee may choose an alternative remedy which is 23 essentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoes 24 of the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge the 25 profits from the article to which the design was\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c1 applied.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 There\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plenty\\n\\n3 of working components, but a design is not a component.\\n\\n4 A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to\\n\\n5 decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either\\n\\n6 a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape\\n\\n7 of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude\\n\\n8 that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW\\n\\n9 Beetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the\\n\\n10 Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer\\n\\n11 copied it.\\n\\n12 The -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documents\\n\\n13 in this case, for example, that are recounted in our\\n\\n14 brief, Samsung realized that it faced what this\\n\\n15 executive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of\\n\\n16 design was reflected, the documents show, in the\\n\\n17 telephone company saying, you have to create something\\n\\n18 like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create\\n\\n19 something like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing\\n\\n20 sales. And in three months --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we go\\n\\n22 back to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far your\\n\\n23 test has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'s\\n\\n24 going towards. Okay.\\n\\n25 They suggest two things. Article of\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n43 1 manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have a 2 four-part test. Do you agree that that four-part test 3 with respect to identifying just the article of 4 manufacture? 5 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveat 6 only. What -- the factors that the jury will be told 7 will depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go to 9 the -- to the record. 10 MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'m 11 sticking with the test. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s the 13 test. 14 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, because 16 it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody 17 else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, 18 are the article of manufacture. 19 Now, the government would say, go to the 20 second test, which takes in some of the things that you 21 were talking about, to figure out how much of the 22 profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to 23 the shape of the car. 24 Now, as Justice Alito said, some people 25 don\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n44 1 just a small car. They want the car that has a certain 2 trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. 3 Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s 4 90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body 5 accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 6 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape 7 of the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis? 8 That\\'s what I understand the government\\'s 9 analysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be told 10 to do, to decide how much value the design is to the 11 product being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in a 12 nutshell. 13 MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a test 14 that the government has articulated here at oral 15 argument. It has not been briefed by anybody. 16 The issue of how you calculate total profits 17 on something less than the whole article as sold was 18 wrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit in 19 the second Piano case, where in the second Piano case, 20 the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test, 21 how do you determine what the article of manufacture is, 22 hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The real 23 difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the 24 profits from that article of manufacture. 25 The -- the few courts that have addressed\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 this that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I\\n\\n45\\n\\n2 think probably makes the most sense and is the least\\n\\n3 difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were\\n\\n4 the costs of producing that article, that particular\\n\\n5 subcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit margin\\n\\n6 on the product as a whole applied to that little\\n\\n7 component?\\n\\n8 Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I\\n\\n9 think that\\'s what courts have generally done. And what\\n\\n10 it underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be\\n\\n11 appropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it\\n\\n12 underscores is the very --\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get off\\n\\n14 track.\\n\\n15 MR. WAXMAN: Okay.\\n\\n16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that part\\n\\n17 of the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'re\\n\\n18 saying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The government\\n\\n19 is saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is\\n\\n20 that right?\\n\\n21 MR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct\\n\\n22 that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the\\n\\n23 total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture\\n\\n24 to which the design has been applied. That is\\n\\n25 relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n46 1 the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is 2 the product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated when 3 the jury concludes that the relevant article of 4 manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where 5 customers could choose an array of cases in which to put 6 the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out 7 total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case. 8 But the decided cases that I have seen have 9 looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what 10 were the direct costs associated with producing the 11 relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on 12 the piano as applied to that. 13 And may I just add one other point which I 14 think is still on track. The problem with that is that 15 it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress 16 was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design 17 Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters 18 and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only 19 compensation was something that could be viewed as the 20 cost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going to 21 get a 10 percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to 22 produce this little component, there would be no 23 deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency. 24 Yes, Justice Kagan. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and I\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 think that the VW example is a good example for this\\n\\n47\\n\\n2 reason -- where the thing that makes the product\\n\\n3 distinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s not\\n\\n4 been a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or\\n\\n5 some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said\\n\\n6 I just have this great idea for an appearance. But\\n\\n7 that\\'s the principal reason why the product has been\\n\\n8 successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to\\n\\n9 do all the other things that cars do, but the principal\\n\\n10 reason why the car has been successful has to do with\\n\\n11 this particular appearance, the design.\\n\\n12 As I understood the government, that does\\n\\n13 not come into the first inquiry. That does not come\\n\\n14 into the question of what is the article. It only comes\\n\\n15 into the second inquiry, which is how much of the\\n\\n16 profits are attributable to that article.\\n\\n17 Do you agree with that?\\n\\n18 MR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- I\\n\\n19 don\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test as\\n\\n20 you have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. I\\n\\n21 think that the government\\'s -- if you look at the\\n\\n22 government\\'s factors, you know, one factor is the\\n\\n23 relative prominence of the design within the product as\\n\\n24 a whole. And the government says that whether the\\n\\n25 design -- in other words, whether the design is a\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n48 1 significant attribute of the entire product affecting 2 the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest 3 that the article should be the product. 4 Another factor in the government\\'s test is 5 the physical relationship between the patented design 6 and the rest of the product. In other words, as the 7 government\\'s brief says, can the user or the seller 8 physically separate it, or is it manufactured 9 separately. 10 Another factor is whether the design is 11 conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, 12 for example, a design on a book binding is different 13 from the intellectual property reflected in the 14 copyright material in the book. Those -- we agree with 15 all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, 16 you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the 17 first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence 18 of the design within the product of the whole is in 19 essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in 20 determining the article of manufacture -- whether the 21 patented design is likely to cause the consumers to 22 purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 23 patentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- I 24 can\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetle 25 example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n49 1 similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or 2 a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebody 3 who looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied the 4 iconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well say 5 that, and a jury would take that into account. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is the 7 approach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as 8 \"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word? 9 MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. And 10 if there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- what 12 word would you use to describe your approach? 13 MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the article 14 of manufacture, to which the design is applied for 15 purposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive and 16 pleasing appearance. Apportionment is what their 17 expert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying the 18 total profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions of 19 dollars, but I find that only one percent of consumers 20 buy phones because of the front face of the phone either 21 off or on. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identified 23 the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily 24 what you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'t 25 see how we can get away from that word.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n50 1 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, Justice 2 Kennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" once 3 you -- if you -- if the jury answers the question at 4 step 1 and says no, no, no, the article of manufacture 5 is the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do we 6 determine total profits from the sale of that thing? 7 You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment that 8 looks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder and 9 what is the -- you know, what is the profit margin for 10 the car or the refrigerator or something like that. 11 That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it if 12 you found it. 13 So, you know, in this case it\\'s a little 14 difficult to figure out what the alternative article of 15 manufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court even 16 before the trial judge, they never even suggested what 17 the article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent, 18 the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is not 20 helpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder is 21 knows what the determination must -- what determination 22 must be made. The factors are helpful in making the 23 determination. 24 Now what you just said about the article of 25 manufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n51 1 applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said? 2 MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury is 3 quoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in 1872 4 decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufacture 5 is the thing to which the design is applied for purposes 6 of sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing, 7 attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to find 8 out -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physical 10 sense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'s 11 what the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s applied 12 to the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it in 13 a different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- where 15 is the design applied? Is it applied to the inside? 16 No. It\\'s applied to the outside. 17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, by 18 definition, applies to the outside. It has to apply to 19 something that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say what 21 it\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms of 22 the physical world, so what is -- what are you talking 23 about? 24 MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked to 25 decide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n52 1 this was a patentable design and you find under Gorham 2 that it was infringed, what is the thing to which that 3 design was applied to give it a pleasing appearance. 4 Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or the 5 software. It is applied to the phone. Now, they could 6 if they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to the 7 jury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to the 9 outside of the phone. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to the 12 outside of an article. It has to be applied to the 13 outside of an article. 14 I see my time is expired. Thank you very 15 much. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 17 Miss Sullivan. Four minutes. 18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that 23 all apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'t 24 apportion the value of the design in relation to the 25 article. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n53 1 not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article from 2 the other articles that make up the product. So we can 3 segregate article from other articles within the 4 product. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do 5 that because it allows total profit only from that 6 article of manufacture to which the design has applied. 7 Now, the test that we ask the Court to 8 announce on remand. As has been discussed, it has two 9 parts. 10 The first is -- the antecedent question is 11 identify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimes 12 that will be very easy if you do it from two main 13 factors. What does the patent scope claim, a front 14 face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? 15 And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the 16 instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we 17 actually asked the jury to be told that where the 18 article of manufacture is a case or external housing, 19 that\\'s the article of manufacture. 20 The second question is quantum of profits. 21 And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying 22 that a lot of the expert determinations about how much 23 did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into 24 play, as the government said and we agree, only at the 25 second question: What is the quantum of profits from\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 the right article of manufacture?\\n\\n54\\n\\n2 But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar\\n\\n3 are we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n4 you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency\\n\\n5 among juries.\\n\\n6 We think the answer to the first question\\n\\n7 can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus\\n\\n8 mainly on two factors: What does the design in the\\n\\n9 patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the\\n\\n10 front face? And second, what is the product to which it\\n\\n11 has been applied? That will help judges to guide\\n\\n12 juries.\\n\\n13 We think we should have had instruction\\n\\n14 42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary\\n\\n15 judgment that the article of manufacture is the front\\n\\n16 face, and that could be instructed to the jury.\\n\\n17 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, is\\n\\n18 that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though\\n\\n19 they only want to apply it to the front.\\n\\n20 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem in\\n\\n22 the case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed to\\n\\n23 the brief I did point to -- that history is matters\\n\\n24 here, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponent\\n\\n25 product.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n55 1 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell the 3 jury that there is that distinction, I think you either 4 disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you 5 create the kind of absurd results that your brief is 6 full of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for. 7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked at 9 page 23, and it says that seems to do it. 10 MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with page 23 of 11 the tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why you 12 must remand in this case. 13 This case was tried under the improper rule 14 of law. We tried at every juncture to get the correct 15 rule of law adopted. And the district court said, I 16 forbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re not 17 asking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article of 18 manufacture. And we were shut down over and over again 19 on that. 20 So you must remand and tell the nation\\'s 21 economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on 22 a portion of a front face of an electronic device and 23 come in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juries 24 should be instructed that the article of manufacture 25 either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary\\n\\n56\\n\\n2 articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon\\n\\n3 might be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,\\n\\n4 but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the\\n\\n5 spoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the\\n\\n6 spoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,\\n\\n7 that\\'s all right.\\n\\n8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of\\n\\n9 showing what is the relevant article? I assume in a\\n\\n10 case like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.\\n\\n11 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave\\n\\n12 you with the most important disagreement we have with\\n\\n13 the government and with Apple, the burden is on the\\n\\n14 plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what\\n\\n15 the article of manufacture is.\\n\\n16 Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiff\\n\\n17 to show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in\\n\\n18 what the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\n19 burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal\\n\\n20 Circuit shows. With respect, we request that you\\n\\n21 remand -- vacate and remand.\\n\\n22 Thank you very much, Your Honor.\\n\\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n24 The case is submitted.\\n\\n25 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial -

The cleaning doesn't have to be perfect, but try to get as many of them as you can without deleting other numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3 and 4. **chop off the beginning/ chop off the end**: now it would be very helpful to get rid of all of the text that comes before the arguments begins, and all the text that comes after the argument (each page has a really annoying index at the end that you don't want to be searching through). Look for words or phrases that uniquely repeat at the beginning and at the end of the arguments. The easiest way to isolate this, to do a simple split() on one of those phrases, and keep the half of The split you want. (Am I being too cryptic here?--a good split should give you list with two elements when you want to keep one of them) Think about it and email me.\n",

       "' 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\\'ll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case No. 15-777, Samsung 5 Electronics v. Apple, Incorporated. 6 Ms. Sullivan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 A smartphone is smart because it contains 12 hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it 13 work. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of 14 the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design 15 patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to 16 total profit on the entire phone. 17 That result makes no sense. A single design 18 patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone 19 should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the 20 profit on the entire phone. 21 Section 289 does not require that result, 22 and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, 23 Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does 24 not require that result. We respectfully ask that the 25 Court hold that when a design patent claims a design\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n4 1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a component 2 of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, 3 when a design patent is applied to an article of 4 manufacture within a multi-article product, we request 5 that you hold that Section 289 entitles the 6 patent-holder to total profit on the article of 7 manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and 8 not the profits on the total product. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how to 10 instruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not the 11 government, both parties kind of leave it up and say, 12 oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simply 13 wouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test. 14 My preference, if -- if I were just making 15 another sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies to 16 see how the -- the extent to which the design affected 17 the consumer, and then the jury would have something to 18 do that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlong 19 into the statute. 20 You can\\'t really have apportionment, so it 21 seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to 22 have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example 23 that\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is 24 a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and 25 just follow the words of the statute. But it seems to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s one\\n\\n4 thing to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --\\n\\n5 if I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do under\\n\\n6 your brief.\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not propose\\n\\n8 a test that simply leaves it to the jury without\\n\\n9 guidance. The instruction we proposed and that was\\n\\n10 rejected by the district court appears in the blue brief\\n\\n11 at page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that\\n\\n12 the article of manufacture to which a design has been\\n\\n13 applied is the part or portion of the product as sold\\n\\n14 that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the\\n\\n15 patent.\\n\\n16 So, Justice Kennedy, our test is very\\n\\n17 simple.\\n\\n18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I just\\n\\n19 don\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the jury\\n\\n20 room; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.\\n\\n21 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what we\\n\\n22 respectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the\\n\\n23 test for what constitutes an article of manufacture.\\n\\n24 And to be clear, I\\'m now stressing our\\n\\n25 article-of-manufacture argument, not the causation\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 argument we gave as an alternative.\\n\\n6\\n\\n2 As the case comes to the Court, all we ask\\n\\n3 is that you rule in favor of us on article of\\n\\n4 manufacture.\\n\\n5 And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us\\n\\n6 what to look at --\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly make\\n\\n8 sure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --\\n\\n9 you\\'re saying we should only look to what an article of\\n\\n10 manufacture is and not your other argument that there\\n\\n11 should be apportionment as to any particular article of\\n\\n12 manufacture.\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n14 We\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the\\n\\n15 case, that a jury should be instructed that total profit\\n\\n16 must be profit derived from the article of manufacture\\n\\n17 to which the design has been applied.\\n\\n18 And, Your Honor, the statute does support\\n\\n19 our test because the statute asks us to look at the\\n\\n20 article of manufacture to which the design has been\\n\\n21 applied.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that in\\n\\n23 this -- in this case?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case it\\n\\n25 is -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n7 1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-cornered 2 front face of a phone. 3 In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular, 4 round-cornered front face of the phone with certain 5 aspect ratio and corner radii. 6 In the D\\'305, it is the display screen on 7 which the graphical user interface appears. 8 So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question, 9 the jury should have been instructed either with our 10 instruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to the 11 jury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article of 12 manufacture here, but it may be less than the entire 13 phone. The article of manufacture may be a part or 14 portion of the phone, and you should look at two things, 15 Your Honor. 16 You should look at the patent, and, Justice 17 Kennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look at 18 the -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought to 19 look at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patent 20 is going to be the best guide to what the design is 21 applied to in many, many cases, as in this case. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seem 23 to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of 24 law, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matter 25 of law.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n8 1 I believe that your basic argument, everyone 2 is in agreement, that the test is an article of 3 manufacture for purposes of sale. 4 But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how 5 do we announce the right test for that? Because the 6 phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer 7 as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. That 8 might be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know. 9 Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how to 10 figure out the component part. I don\\'t know where in 11 the record you would have enough to survive your 12 argument. 13 MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me back 14 up and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence. 15 The -- the test -- and I want to agree with 16 Your Honor. To be clear, we say that what the Federal 17 Circuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrong 18 as a matter of law to hold that the entire product is 19 necessarily the article of manufacture from which you 20 measure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law, 21 but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has to 22 hold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law. 23 It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question of 24 either fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrel 25 question of law and fact.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n9 1 And why does it involve both? Because we 2 know that district courts look at patents. You assign 3 them that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. And 4 when they look at a patent for a claim construction, 5 we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar. 6 The district court can look at the patent 7 and say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. This 8 isn\\'t one of Apple\\'s 13 other patents on other parts of 9 the phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of the 10 entire case. This is the front face patent. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how would 12 you determine the profit attributable to the relevant 13 article of manufacture? 14 MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor. 15 First, through ordinary accounting that 16 would look to the cost of goods sold in relation to 17 revenues for the relevant component. 18 You could look, if -- if a company buys the 19 component from an original equipment manufacturer, you 20 would look to their profit margins and apply that. 21 If, as sometimes happens within a company, 22 one division makes the glass front face and another 23 division makes the innards of the phone, you would find 24 out the transfer pricing between the divisions. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n10 1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent on 2 the inner parts and a hundred million was spent on the 3 face, then it\\'s a 10:1 ratio. 4 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, Your 5 Honor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have expert 7 testimony on all of that. 8 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would. 9 And you would -- but that\\'s just one way. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you had 11 a case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some of 14 the briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle 15 design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of 16 genius and it identified the car. Then it seems to me 17 that that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give three 18 days\\' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop 19 the motor. 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s what 21 we would do with the Beetle. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- it 23 seems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing. 24 MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. To 25 answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n11 1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the 2 total profit from the relevant article of manufactures 3 here, the front face, or the display screen. One could 4 have been accounting. One could have been consumer 5 demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested. 6 Apple could have said well, people really like the front 7 face disproportionately to all the other parts of the 8 phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence 9 to prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence or 10 indirect evidence through consumer survey. But, Your 11 Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total 12 profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be 13 a substantial part of the total profit on the product. 14 Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool, 15 shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. 16 It may be that the article of manufacture to which the 17 design patent is applied is just the exterior body of 18 the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay 19 much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle. 20 They want to pay for the cool way it looks. 21 If that\\'s so, it should be open to the 22 patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come 23 from the exterior of the car. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference in 25 practical terms between that and your causation argument\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 or apportionment?\\n\\n12\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concede\\n\\n5 under article of manufacture that the holder of the\\n\\n6 patent gets profit from the article, even if the profit\\n\\n7 does not come entirely from the design.\\n\\n8 Let me give you an example with a phone\\'s\\n\\n9 front face. Consumers may value the front face because\\n\\n10 it\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,\\n\\n11 because it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give the\\n\\n12 patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all\\n\\n13 the profits for the front face, even if it includes\\n\\n14 profit from those non-design features of the front face,\\n\\n15 where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test\\n\\n16 would limit the profits to the profits from the design\\n\\n17 parts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,\\n\\n18 that\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting a\\n\\n19 little more with article of manufacture than we do with\\n\\n20 a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy\\n\\n21 for that.\\n\\n22 But the reason we think it\\'s consistent with\\n\\n23 Congress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress\\n\\n24 was trying to do was provide a rule that gives\\n\\n25 design-patent holders total profit from the article of\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 manufacture.\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 That\\'s a little bit overinclusive, because\\n\\n3 if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue\\n\\n4 in the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from the\\n\\n5 design, and there will be a little extra you\\'re getting\\n\\n6 perhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress\\n\\n7 was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say\\n\\n8 that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say\\n\\n9 that design causes value in a single article product\\n\\n10 like a rug.\\n\\n11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at this\\n\\n12 record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole\\n\\n13 phone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, they\\n\\n14 were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --\\n\\n15 this was their argument to the jury and it sold the\\n\\n16 Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,\\n\\n17 that, you know, all smartphones basically function the\\n\\n18 same. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.\\n\\n19 This is what they were arguing, and they put on an\\n\\n20 expert that gave total profits. If the jury credited\\n\\n21 them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a\\n\\n22 properly instructed jury, could you overturn that\\n\\n23 finding?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back to\\n\\n25 the proper instruction. The jury was not properly\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 instructed here.\\n\\n14\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,\\n\\n3 Miss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. If\\n\\n5 the article of manufacture was the entire ornamental\\n\\n6 appearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on\\n\\n7 the entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assert\\n\\n8 it here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone\\n\\n9 does not look substantially similar to the entire\\n\\n10 outside of a Samsung phone. The reason why design\\n\\n11 patencies carve the product up into multiple partial\\n\\n12 design claims is so they can make a narrow infringement\\n\\n13 argument and find a little sliver of the phone on which\\n\\n14 infringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate to\\n\\n15 give total profit when they do that.\\n\\n16 So, Your Honor, if there had been a design\\n\\n17 patent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple\\n\\n18 could have tried to get total profit on the entire case.\\n\\n19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\\n\\n20 \"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properly\\n\\n21 instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case\\n\\n22 could not have found for Apple. Is that what --\\n\\n23 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n24 That is very much our position.\\n\\n25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the jury\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 instruction, what was the legal error?\\n\\n15\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in the\\n\\n3 jury instruction --\\n\\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides a\\n\\n5 properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor\\n\\n6 of Apple on the evidence presented?\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,\\n\\n8 because --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides the\\n\\n10 jury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a proper\\n\\n11 instruction was given -- what would have been the legal\\n\\n12 error?\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- no\\n\\n14 reasonable jury could have found on this record that the\\n\\n15 entire product was the article of manufacture to which\\n\\n16 the design has been applied. Two reasons.\\n\\n17 One, design patents cover ornamental\\n\\n18 appearance. They cannot, by definition, cover the\\n\\n19 innards of the phone. So the functional innards of the\\n\\n20 phone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design\\n\\n21 patent.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claim\\n\\n23 the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover the\\n\\n24 innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find\\n\\n25 its -- could find that the consumers and others would\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n16 1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks 2 only. 3 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talking 4 about design patents, not trademark or copyright. 5 There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here on 6 the -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree with 8 you, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answer 10 your question as precisely as I can. Just because you 11 can show that most of the profit comes from the Beetle 12 exterior does not mean the car is the article of 13 manufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test. 14 First, determine what is the article of 15 manufacture. 16 Then second step, determine the quantum of 17 damages, quantum of profits in this case, from that 18 article. 19 Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almost 20 all its profits from the exterior case, people were 21 indifferent to whether they could read their e-mail, 22 navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If you 23 could prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'t 24 happen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvette 25 or the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n17 1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion of 2 the total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at the 4 trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article 5 less than the whole phone? 6 MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. And 7 we were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the jury 8 instruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began, 9 we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket 1322. We said 10 very clearly article of manufacture is less than the 11 total phone and profit should be limited to the profit 12 from the article. We said again in the jury 13 instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully 14 to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on 15 petition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to the 16 court and we said please listen to us about article of 17 manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the 18 article. The district court said, no, I already said no 19 apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no 20 apportionment, she shut us out of both theories. The 21 district court shut us out of article of manufacture as 22 the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of 23 causation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here. 24 So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, our 25 charge conference. And then again in our 50A and the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n18 1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again 2 said article is separate from apportionment, and the 3 article here is less than the phone. At 197 we said 4 at -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is less 5 than the phone. And in the 50B at the close of the 6 first trial, we again said article is less than the 7 phone. 8 Second trial happens on certain phones. 9 Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says 10 again, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment for 11 design patents. You cannot talk to me about article of 12 manufacture. We tried over and over and over again to 13 get the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and we 14 were rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor? 15 Because there was evidence in the case from which a 16 reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found 17 that the components were the front face, the front face, 18 and the display screen. And the evidence came out of 19 Apple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled to 20 rely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again and 21 again said what are you claiming. And when the 22 witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'t 23 say the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'re 24 claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, 25 ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n19 1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore 2 everything that\\'s outside the dotted lines. 3 And if I could just remind you that we\\'ve 4 reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look 5 like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D\\'677. They may 6 look like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was in 7 Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. 8 The claim is for the small portion of the external 9 appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. 10 Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. It 11 disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. 12 And Your Honor, the question for the jury 13 was not did people think that the look and feel of an 14 iPhone was great. The question for the jury was did the 15 very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes 16 look substantially similar to the very small portion of 17 the patent claim? 18 Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in 19 this record for a conclusion that the entire product, 20 profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit 21 from those articles. What Apple should have done is 22 done either of the two things we discussed earlier, 23 accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goods 24 sold on the components, or it should have done consumer 25 survey evidence like our expert did.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n20 1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General has 2 proposed a test with four factors to determine the 3 article question. Do you agree with those? Are there 4 others you would add? 5 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answer 6 briefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time. 7 We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test. 8 We propose a briefer test that we think is more 9 administrable. We propose that you look to two factors: 10 The design in the patent and the accused product. We 11 think our test is more administrable, and it can often 12 be done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do in 13 Markman, who will then instruct the jury and give them 14 guidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further on 15 rebuttal. Thank you very much. 16 I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time, 17 Mr. Chief Justice. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 Mr. Fletcher. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER 21 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 22 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 24 and may it please the Court: 25 This case presents two related questions\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 about the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for\\n\\n21\\n\\n2 design-patent infringement under Section 289. If I\\n\\n3 understood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentation\\n\\n4 correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both\\n\\n5 of those legal questions.\\n\\n6 Just to summarize briefly, first, the court\\n\\n7 of appeals correctly held that Section 289\\'s provision\\n\\n8 for an award of total profits means that the\\n\\n9 patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the\\n\\n10 sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not\\n\\n11 just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder\\n\\n12 can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as\\n\\n13 opposed to other features of the article.\\n\\n14 But second, we read the court of appeals\\'\\n\\n15 opinion to have held that the relevant article of\\n\\n16 manufacture for which profits are owed is always the\\n\\n17 entire product that the infringer sells to customers.\\n\\n18 And we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand all\\n\\n19 parties to agree with that now.\\n\\n20 Instead, the relevant article of manufacture\\n\\n21 to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes\\n\\n22 be a part or a component of a larger product sold in\\n\\n23 commerce. And when that is the case, all parties now\\n\\n24 agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the\\n\\n25 profits from that infringing article and not to all --\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n22 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when the 2 component -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t sold 3 apart from the entire product, how should the -- the 4 judge charge the jury on determining the profit 5 attributable to the infringing article? 6 MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d be 7 two factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed. 8 The first one would be what is the relevant article, and 9 there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case. 10 The second question, once the fact-finder 11 identifies the relevant article, is the question that 12 you asked, which is how much of the total profits from 13 the device are attributable to the infringing article? 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step, 15 and how do you figure it out? 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he complete 17 his answer to my question? 18 MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on the 19 second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a 20 lot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in this 21 case. This case sort of stopped at the first step. But 22 we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that 23 courts have handled other analogous questions, and I 24 point to two areas of law where that\\'s happened. 25 The first is utility patent damages under\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n23 1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the 2 infringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often a 3 patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in 4 commerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitled 5 to the profits that are attributable to the infringing 6 part, but not the whole machine. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- Justice 8 Ginsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her, 9 adequately summarized, the test that you propose at 10 page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include? 11 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test we 12 propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions 13 that I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article of 14 manufacture to which the design has been applied? Once 15 the fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the test 16 that we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to be 17 Justice Sotomayor\\'s question. 18 I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking 19 once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article 20 is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on 21 the car, how do they separate out the part of the 22 profits that are attributable to that component from the 23 whole. 24 And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefed 25 it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n24 1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that 2 courts have confronted in other areas of law. One was 3 utility patent damages, as I described. Another one is 4 discussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in the 5 Sheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a case 6 where the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses be 8 called on in order to show part one or part two or both? 9 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very often 10 both. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would those 12 expert witnesses -- who would they be? What would they 13 say? 14 MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will depend 15 on -- on the circumstances of the case. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case. 17 MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someone 18 familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in 19 the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone 20 company, or someone who is familiar with the market for 21 smartphones and who could speak to on the first question 22 how smartphones are put together, how they are 23 manufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extent 24 to which the components of a smartphone are separable. 25 And then on the second question, the one\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n25 1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be 3 speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in 4 your question in the Sullivan, which is things like 5 consumer surveys, to what extent do the various 6 components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and 7 contribute to the value of the phone. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the 9 things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. I 10 don\\'t understand how that helps on this question. It 11 would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it 12 contributed to profits. 13 MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits from 16 the bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each of 17 these components, and then what share of the revenue is 18 attributable to each of these components. And then you 19 say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up 21 calculation and try to do it that way. 22 Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimes 23 that won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation and 25 said the total profits on this product are $10 million,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n26 1 and we think that the component at issue here, based on 2 expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 3 25 percent. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said based 5 on expert testimony. What would -- what would they be 6 talking about? 7 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldon 8 case that\\'s cited on page 27 of our brief from this 9 Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these 10 problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion 11 the portion -- the profits from a movie that are 12 attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or 13 the directors or other things. And they had experts who 14 were familiar with the industry and who said the script 15 is important but, really, a lot of the value and 16 particularly for a movie like this comes from other 17 things. 18 And there were various expert testimonies 19 that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up 20 saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of 21 the total profits from the movie, and this Court 22 affirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonable 23 approximation. 24 We\\'re not -- never going to be able to get 25 to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable\\n\\n27\\n\\n2 approximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly better\\n\\n3 than awarding all or nothing. And courts have been able\\n\\n4 to come to those reasonable approximations by using\\n\\n5 expert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'ve\\n\\n6 discussed.\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could you\\n\\n8 speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I\\n\\n9 understand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, that\\n\\n10 distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'s\\n\\n11 just -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body of\\n\\n12 the car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a real\\n\\n13 question as to whether it is being -- the design is\\n\\n14 being applied to the car itself.\\n\\n15 So how would you go about thinking about\\n\\n16 that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and\\n\\n17 under what instructions?\\n\\n18 MR. FLETCHER: So we think the basic\\n\\n19 question for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article of\\n\\n20 manufacture to which the design has been applied. We\\n\\n21 think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'s\\n\\n22 observation in Gorham. It\\'s 1871, first design patent\\n\\n23 case that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thing\\n\\n24 that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of\\n\\n25 manufacture.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n28 1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bug 2 example is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be very 3 easy. If the patented design is for a refrigerator 4 latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the 5 distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk about 7 the hard cases. 8 MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases, 9 like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s either 10 the body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court four 11 factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the 12 jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those 13 factors. And so we say you should compare the scope of 14 the patented design as shown in the drawings in the 15 patent, how prominently that design features in the 16 accused article, whether there are other conceptually 17 distinct innovations or components in the article that 18 are not part of or associated with the patented design, 19 and finally the physical relationship between the 20 patented design and the rest of the article. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, how 22 would you decide the Beetle case, or what experts would 23 you want to hear? 24 MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- as 25 to the article, what\\'s the article --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n29 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given you 2 that second option. 3 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s a 4 factual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear from 5 experts who can speak to the question of how is the 6 Beetle put together, and what other parts of the -- the 7 Beetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetle 9 put together? It\\'s put together like every other car. 10 I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whether 11 the shape of the body is distinctive or not. 12 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also want 13 to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that 14 the scope of the claim design covers the whole article, 15 but not the interior of the car. There are design 16 features in the interior that the driver sees that 17 aren\\'t the body of the article. 18 As to the second factor, how prominent is 19 the design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts in 20 favor of finding that the design does cover the whole 21 article. 22 Then the third one is conceptually distinct 23 innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way. 24 There are going to be lots of other features of the car 25 or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 system, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you\\n\\n30\\n\\n2 might want to hear adverse testimony.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the first\\n\\n4 part of the test.\\n\\n5 MR. FLETCHER: Correct.\\n\\n6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article of\\n\\n7 manufacture.\\n\\n8 So now take the second part of the test and\\n\\n9 apply it to the Bug.\\n\\n10 MR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'ve\\n\\n11 decided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug\\n\\n12 is just the body of the Bug.\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\\n\\n14 MR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question is\\n\\n15 the best way to determine that, at least that I can\\n\\n16 think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed\\n\\n17 to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their\\n\\n18 purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and\\n\\n19 to what extent are they instead valuing other things\\n\\n20 like --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that that\\n\\n22 question is not relevant to the first question. In\\n\\n23 other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs\\n\\n24 buy them because of the look of the car.\\n\\n25 MR. FLETCHER: Yes.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n31 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'s 2 only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, 3 which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or the 4 whole car that the design is being applied to? 5 MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s the 6 statute -- the way the statute reads. It says you get 7 profits from the article of manufacture. And so, 8 logically, I think the way to approach it would be 9 identify the article and then let the patent-holder make 10 the argument that even though the article may be just a 11 part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s just 12 the case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sells 13 it. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder, 14 in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'s 15 selling the whole product, still recover a very 16 substantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is not 20 helpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought that 21 nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like 22 the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think, 23 $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What 24 if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? 25 What if it broke down every 50 miles?\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n32 1 So if that is a real question, if it is a 2 real question whether the article of manufacture there 3 is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about 4 the test for determining what is the article of 5 manufacture. 6 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that those 7 things can be taken into account at the second step of 8 the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the 9 relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car, 10 but for all of the reasons you just pointed out. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- you 12 were saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficult 13 question. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors to 14 determine what is the article of manufacture there. 15 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think if 16 you\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test for 17 article of manufacture also lets some of those 18 considerations play into that test, because it gets to 19 whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions, 20 or other components of the product unrelated to the 21 design. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n33 1 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 2 and may it please the Court: 3 Before I address the Court\\'s many questions 4 initiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jury 5 be instructed under what we and the government believe 6 to be the relevant question -- that is, the factual test 7 of whether the relevant article of manufacture is the 8 article as sold or a distinct component of it -- and I 9 think it\\'s very clear to address the questions that 10 Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, and 11 Ms. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened in 12 this case. 13 There is no -- whatever you determine the 14 right instruction should be, there is no basis to 15 overturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case. 16 There were two trials below. In neither 17 trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or 18 witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any 19 article of manufacture other than the phones themselves. 20 In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner, 21 calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones 22 themselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable juror 23 in these trials could possibly have awarded total 24 profits on anything other than the phones, unless this 25 Court holds --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n34 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because the 2 district judge limited them? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happened 4 was, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s a 5 pretrial statement that the parties have to file saying, 6 these are -- the phones are the -- the phones were 7 infringed. The phones are the things that were 8 infringed for purposes of sale, and here is what our 9 evidence is on total profits from the phone. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on this 11 point. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question 12 trying to figure out what the standard is. Now, why 13 can\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your 14 arguments and theirs, and work it out? 15 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not a 16 difficult -- the record in this case is not difficult. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'s 18 difficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'s 21 difficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side. 22 So if I go through and come to the 23 conclusion, at least, that each side has a good 24 argument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focus 25 on the question that is of great importance across\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n35 1 industries and leave the application of that and whether 2 it was properly raised to the lower courts? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this were 4 difficult, it would be entirely appropriate for this 5 Court simply to announce what the law is, which I think 6 there is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'re 7 not suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'t 8 necessary for the Court to do it. 9 This is a case very much like global tech, 10 when you found that the lower court had applied the 11 wrong standard for intentional infringement, and then 12 found that the record -- even -- but under the correct 13 higher standard, the record admitted no other 14 conclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that they 15 never identified to the jury, in either case, any 16 article of manufacture other than the phone. And all of 17 their evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based on 18 the total profits to the phone. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'ll 20 read it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question on 23 the general issue, which I think is tough. And the 24 general question that I have is I have been looking for 25 a standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n36 1 quite close; the parties actually in the government are 2 fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the 3 Internet Association, the software industry. And you 4 know that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and some 5 others. 6 MR. WAXMAN: I do. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did is 8 they went back into history. They have a lot of 9 different cases which they base the standard on, and 10 they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague, 11 but that the design where it\\'s been applied to only 12 part -- it\\'s on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product 13 and does not drive demand for the entire product, the 14 article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only 15 the component to which the design applies. And only 16 profit attributable to that component may be awarded. 17 Now, really, to understand it, you have to 18 have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to 19 understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use 20 examples. And so that kind of standard, with perhaps 21 examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper, 22 you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on the 23 hood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit from 24 the car. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n37 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not? 2 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand your 3 question, and I just want to bookmark the fact that I 4 have not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s 5 question. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead and 7 answer her question. At some point you can come back to 8 it. 9 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer Justice 10 Ginsburg first and then Justice Breyer. 11 Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that 12 Samsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened in 13 the Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report, 14 Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed to 15 present evidence about that -- about the value of design 16 to the total product as a whole. That was 17 apportionment, Judge Koh said. 18 He wanted -- he calculated total profits 19 based on the phone. And his report then said, well, but 20 I believe that only 1 percent of the value of the phone 21 is due to the design or the design of the iconic front 22 face of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him to 23 do because that was apportionment. 24 The question -- the only issue with respect 25 to article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n38 1 either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as a 2 matter of law in a multicomponent product, the article 3 of manufacture must be the portion. 4 They never said that to the jury. They did 5 propose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed the 6 jury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It also 7 directed the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'t 8 approve it. Now, it just so happens that they preserved 9 no relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'re 11 spending an awful lot of time on an issue about what was 12 raised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raised 13 below, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time to 14 turn to Justice Breyer\\'s question. 15 MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to do 16 that. 17 Justice Breyer, the -- there is no question 18 that in an appropriate case the jury can decide whether 19 the article of manufacture to which the design is 20 applied and to which it provides a distinctive and 21 pleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'s 22 actually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers, 23 or it could be a component of it. 24 In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'s 25 really not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n39 1 there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question of 2 fact for the jury. 3 We believe that the -- the four factors that 4 the Solicitor General articulated would be appropriate 5 factors to consider. 6 I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the 8 question of fact? 9 MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to which 11 the law applies? What -- what is the question of fact? 12 MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In a 13 case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing 14 articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should 15 be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find 16 infringement, total profits are awarded on the article 17 of manufacture to which the patented design was applied 18 for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar 19 or distinctive appearance. 20 You may determine that the article of 21 manufacture is the entire product or a distinct 22 component of that product. In making that 23 determination, you may consider, and this would depend 24 on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would 25 include the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n40 1 things. For example, most importantly the identity of 2 what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers. 3 Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers 4 to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 5 patentee\\'s product. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m not 7 grasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to me 8 that the design is applied to the exterior case of the 9 phone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips and 10 wires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And, 14 you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent on 15 something that the consumer can\\'t see. And yet 16 Congress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entire 19 price of the phone. 20 MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded on 21 the article of manufacture to which the design is 22 applied. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, the 24 case is part of it. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n41 1 think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s important 2 to understand that design is not a component and the 3 patented design is not the article of manufacture. The 4 patented design is something that\\'s applied to an 5 article of manufacture. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, 7 these -- these little, the chips and all are articles of 8 manufacture, right? How is the design of the case 9 applied to those chips? 10 MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, if 11 you look at, for example, in the early days, when the 12 patent -- when the design -- when design patents were 13 first permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 of 15 them were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines and 16 things like that. Congress -- when Congress said that 17 you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson 18 cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is 19 infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not 20 happen innocently. 21 When there is infringement of a design, the 22 patentee may choose an alternative remedy which is 23 essentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoes 24 of the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge the 25 profits from the article to which the design was\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c1 applied.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 There\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plenty\\n\\n3 of working components, but a design is not a component.\\n\\n4 A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to\\n\\n5 decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either\\n\\n6 a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape\\n\\n7 of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude\\n\\n8 that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW\\n\\n9 Beetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the\\n\\n10 Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer\\n\\n11 copied it.\\n\\n12 The -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documents\\n\\n13 in this case, for example, that are recounted in our\\n\\n14 brief, Samsung realized that it faced what this\\n\\n15 executive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of\\n\\n16 design was reflected, the documents show, in the\\n\\n17 telephone company saying, you have to create something\\n\\n18 like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create\\n\\n19 something like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing\\n\\n20 sales. And in three months --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we go\\n\\n22 back to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far your\\n\\n23 test has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'s\\n\\n24 going towards. Okay.\\n\\n25 They suggest two things. Article of\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n43 1 manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have a 2 four-part test. Do you agree that that four-part test 3 with respect to identifying just the article of 4 manufacture? 5 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveat 6 only. What -- the factors that the jury will be told 7 will depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go to 9 the -- to the record. 10 MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'m 11 sticking with the test. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s the 13 test. 14 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, because 16 it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody 17 else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, 18 are the article of manufacture. 19 Now, the government would say, go to the 20 second test, which takes in some of the things that you 21 were talking about, to figure out how much of the 22 profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to 23 the shape of the car. 24 Now, as Justice Alito said, some people 25 don\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n44 1 just a small car. They want the car that has a certain 2 trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. 3 Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s 4 90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body 5 accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 6 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape 7 of the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis? 8 That\\'s what I understand the government\\'s 9 analysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be told 10 to do, to decide how much value the design is to the 11 product being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in a 12 nutshell. 13 MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a test 14 that the government has articulated here at oral 15 argument. It has not been briefed by anybody. 16 The issue of how you calculate total profits 17 on something less than the whole article as sold was 18 wrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit in 19 the second Piano case, where in the second Piano case, 20 the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test, 21 how do you determine what the article of manufacture is, 22 hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The real 23 difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the 24 profits from that article of manufacture. 25 The -- the few courts that have addressed\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 this that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I\\n\\n45\\n\\n2 think probably makes the most sense and is the least\\n\\n3 difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were\\n\\n4 the costs of producing that article, that particular\\n\\n5 subcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit margin\\n\\n6 on the product as a whole applied to that little\\n\\n7 component?\\n\\n8 Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I\\n\\n9 think that\\'s what courts have generally done. And what\\n\\n10 it underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be\\n\\n11 appropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it\\n\\n12 underscores is the very --\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get off\\n\\n14 track.\\n\\n15 MR. WAXMAN: Okay.\\n\\n16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that part\\n\\n17 of the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'re\\n\\n18 saying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The government\\n\\n19 is saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is\\n\\n20 that right?\\n\\n21 MR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct\\n\\n22 that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the\\n\\n23 total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture\\n\\n24 to which the design has been applied. That is\\n\\n25 relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n46 1 the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is 2 the product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated when 3 the jury concludes that the relevant article of 4 manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where 5 customers could choose an array of cases in which to put 6 the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out 7 total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case. 8 But the decided cases that I have seen have 9 looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what 10 were the direct costs associated with producing the 11 relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on 12 the piano as applied to that. 13 And may I just add one other point which I 14 think is still on track. The problem with that is that 15 it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress 16 was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design 17 Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters 18 and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only 19 compensation was something that could be viewed as the 20 cost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going to 21 get a 10 percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to 22 produce this little component, there would be no 23 deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency. 24 Yes, Justice Kagan. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and I\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 think that the VW example is a good example for this\\n\\n47\\n\\n2 reason -- where the thing that makes the product\\n\\n3 distinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s not\\n\\n4 been a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or\\n\\n5 some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said\\n\\n6 I just have this great idea for an appearance. But\\n\\n7 that\\'s the principal reason why the product has been\\n\\n8 successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to\\n\\n9 do all the other things that cars do, but the principal\\n\\n10 reason why the car has been successful has to do with\\n\\n11 this particular appearance, the design.\\n\\n12 As I understood the government, that does\\n\\n13 not come into the first inquiry. That does not come\\n\\n14 into the question of what is the article. It only comes\\n\\n15 into the second inquiry, which is how much of the\\n\\n16 profits are attributable to that article.\\n\\n17 Do you agree with that?\\n\\n18 MR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- I\\n\\n19 don\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test as\\n\\n20 you have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. I\\n\\n21 think that the government\\'s -- if you look at the\\n\\n22 government\\'s factors, you know, one factor is the\\n\\n23 relative prominence of the design within the product as\\n\\n24 a whole. And the government says that whether the\\n\\n25 design -- in other words, whether the design is a\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n48 1 significant attribute of the entire product affecting 2 the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest 3 that the article should be the product. 4 Another factor in the government\\'s test is 5 the physical relationship between the patented design 6 and the rest of the product. In other words, as the 7 government\\'s brief says, can the user or the seller 8 physically separate it, or is it manufactured 9 separately. 10 Another factor is whether the design is 11 conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, 12 for example, a design on a book binding is different 13 from the intellectual property reflected in the 14 copyright material in the book. Those -- we agree with 15 all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, 16 you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the 17 first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence 18 of the design within the product of the whole is in 19 essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in 20 determining the article of manufacture -- whether the 21 patented design is likely to cause the consumers to 22 purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 23 patentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- I 24 can\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetle 25 example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n49 1 similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or 2 a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebody 3 who looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied the 4 iconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well say 5 that, and a jury would take that into account. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is the 7 approach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as 8 \"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word? 9 MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. And 10 if there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- what 12 word would you use to describe your approach? 13 MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the article 14 of manufacture, to which the design is applied for 15 purposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive and 16 pleasing appearance. Apportionment is what their 17 expert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying the 18 total profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions of 19 dollars, but I find that only one percent of consumers 20 buy phones because of the front face of the phone either 21 off or on. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identified 23 the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily 24 what you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'t 25 see how we can get away from that word.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n50 1 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, Justice 2 Kennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" once 3 you -- if you -- if the jury answers the question at 4 step 1 and says no, no, no, the article of manufacture 5 is the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do we 6 determine total profits from the sale of that thing? 7 You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment that 8 looks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder and 9 what is the -- you know, what is the profit margin for 10 the car or the refrigerator or something like that. 11 That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it if 12 you found it. 13 So, you know, in this case it\\'s a little 14 difficult to figure out what the alternative article of 15 manufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court even 16 before the trial judge, they never even suggested what 17 the article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent, 18 the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is not 20 helpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder is 21 knows what the determination must -- what determination 22 must be made. The factors are helpful in making the 23 determination. 24 Now what you just said about the article of 25 manufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n51 1 applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said? 2 MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury is 3 quoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in 1872 4 decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufacture 5 is the thing to which the design is applied for purposes 6 of sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing, 7 attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to find 8 out -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physical 10 sense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'s 11 what the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s applied 12 to the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it in 13 a different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- where 15 is the design applied? Is it applied to the inside? 16 No. It\\'s applied to the outside. 17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, by 18 definition, applies to the outside. It has to apply to 19 something that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say what 21 it\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms of 22 the physical world, so what is -- what are you talking 23 about? 24 MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked to 25 decide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n52 1 this was a patentable design and you find under Gorham 2 that it was infringed, what is the thing to which that 3 design was applied to give it a pleasing appearance. 4 Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or the 5 software. It is applied to the phone. Now, they could 6 if they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to the 7 jury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to the 9 outside of the phone. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to the 12 outside of an article. It has to be applied to the 13 outside of an article. 14 I see my time is expired. Thank you very 15 much. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 17 Miss Sullivan. Four minutes. 18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that 23 all apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'t 24 apportion the value of the design in relation to the 25 article. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n53 1 not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article from 2 the other articles that make up the product. So we can 3 segregate article from other articles within the 4 product. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do 5 that because it allows total profit only from that 6 article of manufacture to which the design has applied. 7 Now, the test that we ask the Court to 8 announce on remand. As has been discussed, it has two 9 parts. 10 The first is -- the antecedent question is 11 identify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimes 12 that will be very easy if you do it from two main 13 factors. What does the patent scope claim, a front 14 face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? 15 And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the 16 instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we 17 actually asked the jury to be told that where the 18 article of manufacture is a case or external housing, 19 that\\'s the article of manufacture. 20 The second question is quantum of profits. 21 And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying 22 that a lot of the expert determinations about how much 23 did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into 24 play, as the government said and we agree, only at the 25 second question: What is the quantum of profits from\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 the right article of manufacture?\\n\\n54\\n\\n2 But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar\\n\\n3 are we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n4 you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency\\n\\n5 among juries.\\n\\n6 We think the answer to the first question\\n\\n7 can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus\\n\\n8 mainly on two factors: What does the design in the\\n\\n9 patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the\\n\\n10 front face? And second, what is the product to which it\\n\\n11 has been applied? That will help judges to guide\\n\\n12 juries.\\n\\n13 We think we should have had instruction\\n\\n14 42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary\\n\\n15 judgment that the article of manufacture is the front\\n\\n16 face, and that could be instructed to the jury.\\n\\n17 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, is\\n\\n18 that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though\\n\\n19 they only want to apply it to the front.\\n\\n20 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem in\\n\\n22 the case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed to\\n\\n23 the brief I did point to -- that history is matters\\n\\n24 here, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponent\\n\\n25 product.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n55 1 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell the 3 jury that there is that distinction, I think you either 4 disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you 5 create the kind of absurd results that your brief is 6 full of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for. 7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked at 9 page 23, and it says that seems to do it. 10 MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with page 23 of 11 the tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why you 12 must remand in this case. 13 This case was tried under the improper rule 14 of law. We tried at every juncture to get the correct 15 rule of law adopted. And the district court said, I 16 forbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re not 17 asking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article of 18 manufacture. And we were shut down over and over again 19 on that. 20 So you must remand and tell the nation\\'s 21 economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on 22 a portion of a front face of an electronic device and 23 come in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juries 24 should be instructed that the article of manufacture 25 either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary\\n\\n56\\n\\n2 articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon\\n\\n3 might be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,\\n\\n4 but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the\\n\\n5 spoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the\\n\\n6 spoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,\\n\\n7 that\\'s all right.\\n\\n8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of\\n\\n9 showing what is the relevant article? I assume in a\\n\\n10 case like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.\\n\\n11 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave\\n\\n12 you with the most important disagreement we have with\\n\\n13 the government and with Apple, the burden is on the\\n\\n14 plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what\\n\\n15 the article of manufacture is.\\n\\n16 Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiff\\n\\n17 to show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in\\n\\n18 what the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\n19 burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal\\n\\n20 Circuit shows. With respect, we request that you\\n\\n21 remand -- vacate and remand.\\n\\n22 Thank you very much, Your Honor.\\n\\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n24 The case is submitted.\\n\\n25 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial -

       "' 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\\'ll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case No. 15-777, Samsung 5 Electronics v. Apple, Incorporated. 6 Ms. Sullivan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 A smartphone is smart because it contains 12 hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it 13 work. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of 14 the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design 15 patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to 16 total profit on the entire phone. 17 That result makes no sense. A single design 18 patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone 19 should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the 20 profit on the entire phone. 21 Section 289 does not require that result, 22 and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, 23 Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does 24 not require that result. We respectfully ask that the 25 Court hold that when a design patent claims a design\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n4 1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a component 2 of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, 3 when a design patent is applied to an article of 4 manufacture within a multi-article product, we request 5 that you hold that Section 289 entitles the 6 patent-holder to total profit on the article of 7 manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and 8 not the profits on the total product. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how to 10 instruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not the 11 government, both parties kind of leave it up and say, 12 oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simply 13 wouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test. 14 My preference, if -- if I were just making 15 another sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies to 16 see how the -- the extent to which the design affected 17 the consumer, and then the jury would have something to 18 do that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlong 19 into the statute. 20 You can\\'t really have apportionment, so it 21 seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to 22 have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example 23 that\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is 24 a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and 25 just follow the words of the statute. But it seems to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s one\\n\\n4 thing to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --\\n\\n5 if I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do under\\n\\n6 your brief.\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not propose\\n\\n8 a test that simply leaves it to the jury without\\n\\n9 guidance. The instruction we proposed and that was\\n\\n10 rejected by the district court appears in the blue brief\\n\\n11 at page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that\\n\\n12 the article of manufacture to which a design has been\\n\\n13 applied is the part or portion of the product as sold\\n\\n14 that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the\\n\\n15 patent.\\n\\n16 So, Justice Kennedy, our test is very\\n\\n17 simple.\\n\\n18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I just\\n\\n19 don\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the jury\\n\\n20 room; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.\\n\\n21 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what we\\n\\n22 respectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the\\n\\n23 test for what constitutes an article of manufacture.\\n\\n24 And to be clear, I\\'m now stressing our\\n\\n25 article-of-manufacture argument, not the causation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 argument we gave as an alternative.\\n\\n6\\n\\n2 As the case comes to the Court, all we ask\\n\\n3 is that you rule in favor of us on article of\\n\\n4 manufacture.\\n\\n5 And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us\\n\\n6 what to look at --\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly make\\n\\n8 sure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --\\n\\n9 you\\'re saying we should only look to what an article of\\n\\n10 manufacture is and not your other argument that there\\n\\n11 should be apportionment as to any particular article of\\n\\n12 manufacture.\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n14 We\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the\\n\\n15 case, that a jury should be instructed that total profit\\n\\n16 must be profit derived from the article of manufacture\\n\\n17 to which the design has been applied.\\n\\n18 And, Your Honor, the statute does support\\n\\n19 our test because the statute asks us to look at the\\n\\n20 article of manufacture to which the design has been\\n\\n21 applied.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that in\\n\\n23 this -- in this case?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case it\\n\\n25 is -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n7 1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-cornered 2 front face of a phone. 3 In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular, 4 round-cornered front face of the phone with certain 5 aspect ratio and corner radii. 6 In the D\\'305, it is the display screen on 7 which the graphical user interface appears. 8 So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question, 9 the jury should have been instructed either with our 10 instruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to the 11 jury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article of 12 manufacture here, but it may be less than the entire 13 phone. The article of manufacture may be a part or 14 portion of the phone, and you should look at two things, 15 Your Honor. 16 You should look at the patent, and, Justice 17 Kennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look at 18 the -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought to 19 look at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patent 20 is going to be the best guide to what the design is 21 applied to in many, many cases, as in this case. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seem 23 to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of 24 law, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matter 25 of law.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n8 1 I believe that your basic argument, everyone 2 is in agreement, that the test is an article of 3 manufacture for purposes of sale. 4 But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how 5 do we announce the right test for that? Because the 6 phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer 7 as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. That 8 might be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know. 9 Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how to 10 figure out the component part. I don\\'t know where in 11 the record you would have enough to survive your 12 argument. 13 MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me back 14 up and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence. 15 The -- the test -- and I want to agree with 16 Your Honor. To be clear, we say that what the Federal 17 Circuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrong 18 as a matter of law to hold that the entire product is 19 necessarily the article of manufacture from which you 20 measure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law, 21 but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has to 22 hold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law. 23 It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question of 24 either fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrel 25 question of law and fact.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n9 1 And why does it involve both? Because we 2 know that district courts look at patents. You assign 3 them that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. And 4 when they look at a patent for a claim construction, 5 we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar. 6 The district court can look at the patent 7 and say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. This 8 isn\\'t one of Apple\\'s 13 other patents on other parts of 9 the phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of the 10 entire case. This is the front face patent. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how would 12 you determine the profit attributable to the relevant 13 article of manufacture? 14 MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor. 15 First, through ordinary accounting that 16 would look to the cost of goods sold in relation to 17 revenues for the relevant component. 18 You could look, if -- if a company buys the 19 component from an original equipment manufacturer, you 20 would look to their profit margins and apply that. 21 If, as sometimes happens within a company, 22 one division makes the glass front face and another 23 division makes the innards of the phone, you would find 24 out the transfer pricing between the divisions. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n10 1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent on 2 the inner parts and a hundred million was spent on the 3 face, then it\\'s a 10:1 ratio. 4 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, Your 5 Honor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have expert 7 testimony on all of that. 8 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would. 9 And you would -- but that\\'s just one way. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you had 11 a case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some of 14 the briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle 15 design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of 16 genius and it identified the car. Then it seems to me 17 that that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give three 18 days\\' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop 19 the motor. 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s what 21 we would do with the Beetle. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- it 23 seems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing. 24 MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. To 25 answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n11 1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the 2 total profit from the relevant article of manufactures 3 here, the front face, or the display screen. One could 4 have been accounting. One could have been consumer 5 demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested. 6 Apple could have said well, people really like the front 7 face disproportionately to all the other parts of the 8 phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence 9 to prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence or 10 indirect evidence through consumer survey. But, Your 11 Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total 12 profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be 13 a substantial part of the total profit on the product. 14 Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool, 15 shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. 16 It may be that the article of manufacture to which the 17 design patent is applied is just the exterior body of 18 the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay 19 much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle. 20 They want to pay for the cool way it looks. 21 If that\\'s so, it should be open to the 22 patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come 23 from the exterior of the car. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference in 25 practical terms between that and your causation argument\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 or apportionment?\\n\\n12\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concede\\n\\n5 under article of manufacture that the holder of the\\n\\n6 patent gets profit from the article, even if the profit\\n\\n7 does not come entirely from the design.\\n\\n8 Let me give you an example with a phone\\'s\\n\\n9 front face. Consumers may value the front face because\\n\\n10 it\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,\\n\\n11 because it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give the\\n\\n12 patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all\\n\\n13 the profits for the front face, even if it includes\\n\\n14 profit from those non-design features of the front face,\\n\\n15 where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test\\n\\n16 would limit the profits to the profits from the design\\n\\n17 parts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,\\n\\n18 that\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting a\\n\\n19 little more with article of manufacture than we do with\\n\\n20 a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy\\n\\n21 for that.\\n\\n22 But the reason we think it\\'s consistent with\\n\\n23 Congress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress\\n\\n24 was trying to do was provide a rule that gives\\n\\n25 design-patent holders total profit from the article of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 manufacture.\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 That\\'s a little bit overinclusive, because\\n\\n3 if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue\\n\\n4 in the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from the\\n\\n5 design, and there will be a little extra you\\'re getting\\n\\n6 perhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress\\n\\n7 was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say\\n\\n8 that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say\\n\\n9 that design causes value in a single article product\\n\\n10 like a rug.\\n\\n11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at this\\n\\n12 record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole\\n\\n13 phone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, they\\n\\n14 were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --\\n\\n15 this was their argument to the jury and it sold the\\n\\n16 Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,\\n\\n17 that, you know, all smartphones basically function the\\n\\n18 same. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.\\n\\n19 This is what they were arguing, and they put on an\\n\\n20 expert that gave total profits. If the jury credited\\n\\n21 them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a\\n\\n22 properly instructed jury, could you overturn that\\n\\n23 finding?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back to\\n\\n25 the proper instruction. The jury was not properly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 instructed here.\\n\\n14\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,\\n\\n3 Miss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. If\\n\\n5 the article of manufacture was the entire ornamental\\n\\n6 appearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on\\n\\n7 the entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assert\\n\\n8 it here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone\\n\\n9 does not look substantially similar to the entire\\n\\n10 outside of a Samsung phone. The reason why design\\n\\n11 patencies carve the product up into multiple partial\\n\\n12 design claims is so they can make a narrow infringement\\n\\n13 argument and find a little sliver of the phone on which\\n\\n14 infringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate to\\n\\n15 give total profit when they do that.\\n\\n16 So, Your Honor, if there had been a design\\n\\n17 patent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple\\n\\n18 could have tried to get total profit on the entire case.\\n\\n19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\\n\\n20 \"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properly\\n\\n21 instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case\\n\\n22 could not have found for Apple. Is that what --\\n\\n23 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n24 That is very much our position.\\n\\n25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the jury\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 instruction, what was the legal error?\\n\\n15\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in the\\n\\n3 jury instruction --\\n\\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides a\\n\\n5 properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor\\n\\n6 of Apple on the evidence presented?\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,\\n\\n8 because --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides the\\n\\n10 jury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a proper\\n\\n11 instruction was given -- what would have been the legal\\n\\n12 error?\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- no\\n\\n14 reasonable jury could have found on this record that the\\n\\n15 entire product was the article of manufacture to which\\n\\n16 the design has been applied. Two reasons.\\n\\n17 One, design patents cover ornamental\\n\\n18 appearance. They cannot, by definition, cover the\\n\\n19 innards of the phone. So the functional innards of the\\n\\n20 phone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design\\n\\n21 patent.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claim\\n\\n23 the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover the\\n\\n24 innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find\\n\\n25 its -- could find that the consumers and others would\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n16 1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks 2 only. 3 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talking 4 about design patents, not trademark or copyright. 5 There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here on 6 the -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree with 8 you, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answer 10 your question as precisely as I can. Just because you 11 can show that most of the profit comes from the Beetle 12 exterior does not mean the car is the article of 13 manufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test. 14 First, determine what is the article of 15 manufacture. 16 Then second step, determine the quantum of 17 damages, quantum of profits in this case, from that 18 article. 19 Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almost 20 all its profits from the exterior case, people were 21 indifferent to whether they could read their e-mail, 22 navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If you 23 could prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'t 24 happen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvette 25 or the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n17 1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion of 2 the total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at the 4 trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article 5 less than the whole phone? 6 MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. And 7 we were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the jury 8 instruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began, 9 we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket 1322. We said 10 very clearly article of manufacture is less than the 11 total phone and profit should be limited to the profit 12 from the article. We said again in the jury 13 instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully 14 to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on 15 petition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to the 16 court and we said please listen to us about article of 17 manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the 18 article. The district court said, no, I already said no 19 apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no 20 apportionment, she shut us out of both theories. The 21 district court shut us out of article of manufacture as 22 the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of 23 causation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here. 24 So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, our 25 charge conference. And then again in our 50A and the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n18 1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again 2 said article is separate from apportionment, and the 3 article here is less than the phone. At 197 we said 4 at -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is less 5 than the phone. And in the 50B at the close of the 6 first trial, we again said article is less than the 7 phone. 8 Second trial happens on certain phones. 9 Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says 10 again, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment for 11 design patents. You cannot talk to me about article of 12 manufacture. We tried over and over and over again to 13 get the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and we 14 were rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor? 15 Because there was evidence in the case from which a 16 reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found 17 that the components were the front face, the front face, 18 and the display screen. And the evidence came out of 19 Apple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled to 20 rely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again and 21 again said what are you claiming. And when the 22 witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'t 23 say the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'re 24 claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, 25 ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n19 1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore 2 everything that\\'s outside the dotted lines. 3 And if I could just remind you that we\\'ve 4 reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look 5 like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D\\'677. They may 6 look like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was in 7 Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. 8 The claim is for the small portion of the external 9 appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. 10 Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. It 11 disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. 12 And Your Honor, the question for the jury 13 was not did people think that the look and feel of an 14 iPhone was great. The question for the jury was did the 15 very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes 16 look substantially similar to the very small portion of 17 the patent claim? 18 Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in 19 this record for a conclusion that the entire product, 20 profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit 21 from those articles. What Apple should have done is 22 done either of the two things we discussed earlier, 23 accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goods 24 sold on the components, or it should have done consumer 25 survey evidence like our expert did.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n20 1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General has 2 proposed a test with four factors to determine the 3 article question. Do you agree with those? Are there 4 others you would add? 5 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answer 6 briefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time. 7 We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test. 8 We propose a briefer test that we think is more 9 administrable. We propose that you look to two factors: 10 The design in the patent and the accused product. We 11 think our test is more administrable, and it can often 12 be done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do in 13 Markman, who will then instruct the jury and give them 14 guidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further on 15 rebuttal. Thank you very much. 16 I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time, 17 Mr. Chief Justice. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 Mr. Fletcher. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER 21 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 22 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 24 and may it please the Court: 25 This case presents two related questions\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 about the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for\\n\\n21\\n\\n2 design-patent infringement under Section 289. If I\\n\\n3 understood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentation\\n\\n4 correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both\\n\\n5 of those legal questions.\\n\\n6 Just to summarize briefly, first, the court\\n\\n7 of appeals correctly held that Section 289\\'s provision\\n\\n8 for an award of total profits means that the\\n\\n9 patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the\\n\\n10 sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not\\n\\n11 just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder\\n\\n12 can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as\\n\\n13 opposed to other features of the article.\\n\\n14 But second, we read the court of appeals\\'\\n\\n15 opinion to have held that the relevant article of\\n\\n16 manufacture for which profits are owed is always the\\n\\n17 entire product that the infringer sells to customers.\\n\\n18 And we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand all\\n\\n19 parties to agree with that now.\\n\\n20 Instead, the relevant article of manufacture\\n\\n21 to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes\\n\\n22 be a part or a component of a larger product sold in\\n\\n23 commerce. And when that is the case, all parties now\\n\\n24 agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the\\n\\n25 profits from that infringing article and not to all --\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n22 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when the 2 component -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t sold 3 apart from the entire product, how should the -- the 4 judge charge the jury on determining the profit 5 attributable to the infringing article? 6 MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d be 7 two factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed. 8 The first one would be what is the relevant article, and 9 there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case. 10 The second question, once the fact-finder 11 identifies the relevant article, is the question that 12 you asked, which is how much of the total profits from 13 the device are attributable to the infringing article? 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step, 15 and how do you figure it out? 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he complete 17 his answer to my question? 18 MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on the 19 second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a 20 lot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in this 21 case. This case sort of stopped at the first step. But 22 we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that 23 courts have handled other analogous questions, and I 24 point to two areas of law where that\\'s happened. 25 The first is utility patent damages under\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n23 1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the 2 infringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often a 3 patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in 4 commerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitled 5 to the profits that are attributable to the infringing 6 part, but not the whole machine. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- Justice 8 Ginsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her, 9 adequately summarized, the test that you propose at 10 page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include? 11 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test we 12 propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions 13 that I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article of 14 manufacture to which the design has been applied? Once 15 the fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the test 16 that we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to be 17 Justice Sotomayor\\'s question. 18 I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking 19 once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article 20 is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on 21 the car, how do they separate out the part of the 22 profits that are attributable to that component from the 23 whole. 24 And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefed 25 it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n24 1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that 2 courts have confronted in other areas of law. One was 3 utility patent damages, as I described. Another one is 4 discussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in the 5 Sheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a case 6 where the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses be 8 called on in order to show part one or part two or both? 9 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very often 10 both. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would those 12 expert witnesses -- who would they be? What would they 13 say? 14 MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will depend 15 on -- on the circumstances of the case. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case. 17 MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someone 18 familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in 19 the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone 20 company, or someone who is familiar with the market for 21 smartphones and who could speak to on the first question 22 how smartphones are put together, how they are 23 manufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extent 24 to which the components of a smartphone are separable. 25 And then on the second question, the one\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n25 1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be 3 speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in 4 your question in the Sullivan, which is things like 5 consumer surveys, to what extent do the various 6 components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and 7 contribute to the value of the phone. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the 9 things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. I 10 don\\'t understand how that helps on this question. It 11 would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it 12 contributed to profits. 13 MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits from 16 the bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each of 17 these components, and then what share of the revenue is 18 attributable to each of these components. And then you 19 say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up 21 calculation and try to do it that way. 22 Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimes 23 that won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation and 25 said the total profits on this product are $10 million,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26 1 and we think that the component at issue here, based on 2 expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 3 25 percent. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said based 5 on expert testimony. What would -- what would they be 6 talking about? 7 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldon 8 case that\\'s cited on page 27 of our brief from this 9 Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these 10 problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion 11 the portion -- the profits from a movie that are 12 attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or 13 the directors or other things. And they had experts who 14 were familiar with the industry and who said the script 15 is important but, really, a lot of the value and 16 particularly for a movie like this comes from other 17 things. 18 And there were various expert testimonies 19 that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up 20 saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of 21 the total profits from the movie, and this Court 22 affirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonable 23 approximation. 24 We\\'re not -- never going to be able to get 25 to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable\\n\\n27\\n\\n2 approximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly better\\n\\n3 than awarding all or nothing. And courts have been able\\n\\n4 to come to those reasonable approximations by using\\n\\n5 expert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'ve\\n\\n6 discussed.\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could you\\n\\n8 speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I\\n\\n9 understand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, that\\n\\n10 distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'s\\n\\n11 just -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body of\\n\\n12 the car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a real\\n\\n13 question as to whether it is being -- the design is\\n\\n14 being applied to the car itself.\\n\\n15 So how would you go about thinking about\\n\\n16 that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and\\n\\n17 under what instructions?\\n\\n18 MR. FLETCHER: So we think the basic\\n\\n19 question for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article of\\n\\n20 manufacture to which the design has been applied. We\\n\\n21 think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'s\\n\\n22 observation in Gorham. It\\'s 1871, first design patent\\n\\n23 case that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thing\\n\\n24 that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of\\n\\n25 manufacture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n28 1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bug 2 example is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be very 3 easy. If the patented design is for a refrigerator 4 latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the 5 distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk about 7 the hard cases. 8 MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases, 9 like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s either 10 the body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court four 11 factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the 12 jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those 13 factors. And so we say you should compare the scope of 14 the patented design as shown in the drawings in the 15 patent, how prominently that design features in the 16 accused article, whether there are other conceptually 17 distinct innovations or components in the article that 18 are not part of or associated with the patented design, 19 and finally the physical relationship between the 20 patented design and the rest of the article. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, how 22 would you decide the Beetle case, or what experts would 23 you want to hear? 24 MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- as 25 to the article, what\\'s the article --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n29 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given you 2 that second option. 3 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s a 4 factual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear from 5 experts who can speak to the question of how is the 6 Beetle put together, and what other parts of the -- the 7 Beetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetle 9 put together? It\\'s put together like every other car. 10 I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whether 11 the shape of the body is distinctive or not. 12 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also want 13 to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that 14 the scope of the claim design covers the whole article, 15 but not the interior of the car. There are design 16 features in the interior that the driver sees that 17 aren\\'t the body of the article. 18 As to the second factor, how prominent is 19 the design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts in 20 favor of finding that the design does cover the whole 21 article. 22 Then the third one is conceptually distinct 23 innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way. 24 There are going to be lots of other features of the car 25 or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 system, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you\\n\\n30\\n\\n2 might want to hear adverse testimony.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the first\\n\\n4 part of the test.\\n\\n5 MR. FLETCHER: Correct.\\n\\n6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article of\\n\\n7 manufacture.\\n\\n8 So now take the second part of the test and\\n\\n9 apply it to the Bug.\\n\\n10 MR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'ve\\n\\n11 decided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug\\n\\n12 is just the body of the Bug.\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\\n\\n14 MR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question is\\n\\n15 the best way to determine that, at least that I can\\n\\n16 think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed\\n\\n17 to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their\\n\\n18 purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and\\n\\n19 to what extent are they instead valuing other things\\n\\n20 like --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that that\\n\\n22 question is not relevant to the first question. In\\n\\n23 other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs\\n\\n24 buy them because of the look of the car.\\n\\n25 MR. FLETCHER: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'s 2 only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, 3 which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or the 4 whole car that the design is being applied to? 5 MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s the 6 statute -- the way the statute reads. It says you get 7 profits from the article of manufacture. And so, 8 logically, I think the way to approach it would be 9 identify the article and then let the patent-holder make 10 the argument that even though the article may be just a 11 part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s just 12 the case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sells 13 it. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder, 14 in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'s 15 selling the whole product, still recover a very 16 substantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is not 20 helpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought that 21 nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like 22 the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think, 23 $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What 24 if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? 25 What if it broke down every 50 miles?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32 1 So if that is a real question, if it is a 2 real question whether the article of manufacture there 3 is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about 4 the test for determining what is the article of 5 manufacture. 6 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that those 7 things can be taken into account at the second step of 8 the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the 9 relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car, 10 but for all of the reasons you just pointed out. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- you 12 were saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficult 13 question. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors to 14 determine what is the article of manufacture there. 15 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think if 16 you\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test for 17 article of manufacture also lets some of those 18 considerations play into that test, because it gets to 19 whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions, 20 or other components of the product unrelated to the 21 design. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33 1 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 2 and may it please the Court: 3 Before I address the Court\\'s many questions 4 initiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jury 5 be instructed under what we and the government believe 6 to be the relevant question -- that is, the factual test 7 of whether the relevant article of manufacture is the 8 article as sold or a distinct component of it -- and I 9 think it\\'s very clear to address the questions that 10 Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, and 11 Ms. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened in 12 this case. 13 There is no -- whatever you determine the 14 right instruction should be, there is no basis to 15 overturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case. 16 There were two trials below. In neither 17 trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or 18 witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any 19 article of manufacture other than the phones themselves. 20 In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner, 21 calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones 22 themselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable juror 23 in these trials could possibly have awarded total 24 profits on anything other than the phones, unless this 25 Court holds --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n34 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because the 2 district judge limited them? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happened 4 was, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s a 5 pretrial statement that the parties have to file saying, 6 these are -- the phones are the -- the phones were 7 infringed. The phones are the things that were 8 infringed for purposes of sale, and here is what our 9 evidence is on total profits from the phone. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on this 11 point. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question 12 trying to figure out what the standard is. Now, why 13 can\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your 14 arguments and theirs, and work it out? 15 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not a 16 difficult -- the record in this case is not difficult. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'s 18 difficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'s 21 difficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side. 22 So if I go through and come to the 23 conclusion, at least, that each side has a good 24 argument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focus 25 on the question that is of great importance across\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35 1 industries and leave the application of that and whether 2 it was properly raised to the lower courts? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this were 4 difficult, it would be entirely appropriate for this 5 Court simply to announce what the law is, which I think 6 there is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'re 7 not suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'t 8 necessary for the Court to do it. 9 This is a case very much like global tech, 10 when you found that the lower court had applied the 11 wrong standard for intentional infringement, and then 12 found that the record -- even -- but under the correct 13 higher standard, the record admitted no other 14 conclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that they 15 never identified to the jury, in either case, any 16 article of manufacture other than the phone. And all of 17 their evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based on 18 the total profits to the phone. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'ll 20 read it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question on 23 the general issue, which I think is tough. And the 24 general question that I have is I have been looking for 25 a standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n36 1 quite close; the parties actually in the government are 2 fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the 3 Internet Association, the software industry. And you 4 know that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and some 5 others. 6 MR. WAXMAN: I do. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did is 8 they went back into history. They have a lot of 9 different cases which they base the standard on, and 10 they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague, 11 but that the design where it\\'s been applied to only 12 part -- it\\'s on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product 13 and does not drive demand for the entire product, the 14 article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only 15 the component to which the design applies. And only 16 profit attributable to that component may be awarded. 17 Now, really, to understand it, you have to 18 have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to 19 understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use 20 examples. And so that kind of standard, with perhaps 21 examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper, 22 you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on the 23 hood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit from 24 the car. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n37 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not? 2 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand your 3 question, and I just want to bookmark the fact that I 4 have not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s 5 question. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead and 7 answer her question. At some point you can come back to 8 it. 9 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer Justice 10 Ginsburg first and then Justice Breyer. 11 Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that 12 Samsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened in 13 the Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report, 14 Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed to 15 present evidence about that -- about the value of design 16 to the total product as a whole. That was 17 apportionment, Judge Koh said. 18 He wanted -- he calculated total profits 19 based on the phone. And his report then said, well, but 20 I believe that only 1 percent of the value of the phone 21 is due to the design or the design of the iconic front 22 face of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him to 23 do because that was apportionment. 24 The question -- the only issue with respect 25 to article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n38 1 either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as a 2 matter of law in a multicomponent product, the article 3 of manufacture must be the portion. 4 They never said that to the jury. They did 5 propose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed the 6 jury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It also 7 directed the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'t 8 approve it. Now, it just so happens that they preserved 9 no relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'re 11 spending an awful lot of time on an issue about what was 12 raised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raised 13 below, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time to 14 turn to Justice Breyer\\'s question. 15 MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to do 16 that. 17 Justice Breyer, the -- there is no question 18 that in an appropriate case the jury can decide whether 19 the article of manufacture to which the design is 20 applied and to which it provides a distinctive and 21 pleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'s 22 actually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers, 23 or it could be a component of it. 24 In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'s 25 really not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n39 1 there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question of 2 fact for the jury. 3 We believe that the -- the four factors that 4 the Solicitor General articulated would be appropriate 5 factors to consider. 6 I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the 8 question of fact? 9 MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to which 11 the law applies? What -- what is the question of fact? 12 MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In a 13 case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing 14 articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should 15 be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find 16 infringement, total profits are awarded on the article 17 of manufacture to which the patented design was applied 18 for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar 19 or distinctive appearance. 20 You may determine that the article of 21 manufacture is the entire product or a distinct 22 component of that product. In making that 23 determination, you may consider, and this would depend 24 on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would 25 include the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n40 1 things. For example, most importantly the identity of 2 what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers. 3 Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers 4 to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 5 patentee\\'s product. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m not 7 grasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to me 8 that the design is applied to the exterior case of the 9 phone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips and 10 wires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And, 14 you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent on 15 something that the consumer can\\'t see. And yet 16 Congress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entire 19 price of the phone. 20 MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded on 21 the article of manufacture to which the design is 22 applied. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, the 24 case is part of it. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n41 1 think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s important 2 to understand that design is not a component and the 3 patented design is not the article of manufacture. The 4 patented design is something that\\'s applied to an 5 article of manufacture. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, 7 these -- these little, the chips and all are articles of 8 manufacture, right? How is the design of the case 9 applied to those chips? 10 MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, if 11 you look at, for example, in the early days, when the 12 patent -- when the design -- when design patents were 13 first permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 of 15 them were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines and 16 things like that. Congress -- when Congress said that 17 you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson 18 cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is 19 infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not 20 happen innocently. 21 When there is infringement of a design, the 22 patentee may choose an alternative remedy which is 23 essentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoes 24 of the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge the 25 profits from the article to which the design was\\n\\n\\n\\x0c1 applied.\\n\\n\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 There\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plenty\\n\\n3 of working components, but a design is not a component.\\n\\n4 A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to\\n\\n5 decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either\\n\\n6 a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape\\n\\n7 of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude\\n\\n8 that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW\\n\\n9 Beetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the\\n\\n10 Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer\\n\\n11 copied it.\\n\\n12 The -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documents\\n\\n13 in this case, for example, that are recounted in our\\n\\n14 brief, Samsung realized that it faced what this\\n\\n15 executive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of\\n\\n16 design was reflected, the documents show, in the\\n\\n17 telephone company saying, you have to create something\\n\\n18 like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create\\n\\n19 something like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing\\n\\n20 sales. And in three months --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we go\\n\\n22 back to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far your\\n\\n23 test has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'s\\n\\n24 going towards. Okay.\\n\\n25 They suggest two things. Article of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n43 1 manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have a 2 four-part test. Do you agree that that four-part test 3 with respect to identifying just the article of 4 manufacture? 5 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveat 6 only. What -- the factors that the jury will be told 7 will depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go to 9 the -- to the record. 10 MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'m 11 sticking with the test. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s the 13 test. 14 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, because 16 it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody 17 else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, 18 are the article of manufacture. 19 Now, the government would say, go to the 20 second test, which takes in some of the things that you 21 were talking about, to figure out how much of the 22 profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to 23 the shape of the car. 24 Now, as Justice Alito said, some people 25 don\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44 1 just a small car. They want the car that has a certain 2 trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. 3 Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s 4 90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body 5 accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 6 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape 7 of the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis? 8 That\\'s what I understand the government\\'s 9 analysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be told 10 to do, to decide how much value the design is to the 11 product being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in a 12 nutshell. 13 MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a test 14 that the government has articulated here at oral 15 argument. It has not been briefed by anybody. 16 The issue of how you calculate total profits 17 on something less than the whole article as sold was 18 wrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit in 19 the second Piano case, where in the second Piano case, 20 the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test, 21 how do you determine what the article of manufacture is, 22 hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The real 23 difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the 24 profits from that article of manufacture. 25 The -- the few courts that have addressed\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 this that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I\\n\\n45\\n\\n2 think probably makes the most sense and is the least\\n\\n3 difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were\\n\\n4 the costs of producing that article, that particular\\n\\n5 subcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit margin\\n\\n6 on the product as a whole applied to that little\\n\\n7 component?\\n\\n8 Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I\\n\\n9 think that\\'s what courts have generally done. And what\\n\\n10 it underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be\\n\\n11 appropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it\\n\\n12 underscores is the very --\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get off\\n\\n14 track.\\n\\n15 MR. WAXMAN: Okay.\\n\\n16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that part\\n\\n17 of the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'re\\n\\n18 saying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The government\\n\\n19 is saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is\\n\\n20 that right?\\n\\n21 MR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct\\n\\n22 that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the\\n\\n23 total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture\\n\\n24 to which the design has been applied. That is\\n\\n25 relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n46 1 the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is 2 the product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated when 3 the jury concludes that the relevant article of 4 manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where 5 customers could choose an array of cases in which to put 6 the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out 7 total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case. 8 But the decided cases that I have seen have 9 looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what 10 were the direct costs associated with producing the 11 relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on 12 the piano as applied to that. 13 And may I just add one other point which I 14 think is still on track. The problem with that is that 15 it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress 16 was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design 17 Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters 18 and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only 19 compensation was something that could be viewed as the 20 cost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going to 21 get a 10 percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to 22 produce this little component, there would be no 23 deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency. 24 Yes, Justice Kagan. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and I\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 think that the VW example is a good example for this\\n\\n47\\n\\n2 reason -- where the thing that makes the product\\n\\n3 distinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s not\\n\\n4 been a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or\\n\\n5 some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said\\n\\n6 I just have this great idea for an appearance. But\\n\\n7 that\\'s the principal reason why the product has been\\n\\n8 successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to\\n\\n9 do all the other things that cars do, but the principal\\n\\n10 reason why the car has been successful has to do with\\n\\n11 this particular appearance, the design.\\n\\n12 As I understood the government, that does\\n\\n13 not come into the first inquiry. That does not come\\n\\n14 into the question of what is the article. It only comes\\n\\n15 into the second inquiry, which is how much of the\\n\\n16 profits are attributable to that article.\\n\\n17 Do you agree with that?\\n\\n18 MR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- I\\n\\n19 don\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test as\\n\\n20 you have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. I\\n\\n21 think that the government\\'s -- if you look at the\\n\\n22 government\\'s factors, you know, one factor is the\\n\\n23 relative prominence of the design within the product as\\n\\n24 a whole. And the government says that whether the\\n\\n25 design -- in other words, whether the design is a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n48 1 significant attribute of the entire product affecting 2 the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest 3 that the article should be the product. 4 Another factor in the government\\'s test is 5 the physical relationship between the patented design 6 and the rest of the product. In other words, as the 7 government\\'s brief says, can the user or the seller 8 physically separate it, or is it manufactured 9 separately. 10 Another factor is whether the design is 11 conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, 12 for example, a design on a book binding is different 13 from the intellectual property reflected in the 14 copyright material in the book. Those -- we agree with 15 all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, 16 you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the 17 first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence 18 of the design within the product of the whole is in 19 essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in 20 determining the article of manufacture -- whether the 21 patented design is likely to cause the consumers to 22 purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 23 patentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- I 24 can\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetle 25 example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n49 1 similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or 2 a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebody 3 who looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied the 4 iconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well say 5 that, and a jury would take that into account. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is the 7 approach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as 8 \"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word? 9 MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. And 10 if there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- what 12 word would you use to describe your approach? 13 MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the article 14 of manufacture, to which the design is applied for 15 purposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive and 16 pleasing appearance. Apportionment is what their 17 expert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying the 18 total profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions of 19 dollars, but I find that only one percent of consumers 20 buy phones because of the front face of the phone either 21 off or on. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identified 23 the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily 24 what you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'t 25 see how we can get away from that word.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n50 1 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, Justice 2 Kennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" once 3 you -- if you -- if the jury answers the question at 4 step 1 and says no, no, no, the article of manufacture 5 is the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do we 6 determine total profits from the sale of that thing? 7 You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment that 8 looks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder and 9 what is the -- you know, what is the profit margin for 10 the car or the refrigerator or something like that. 11 That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it if 12 you found it. 13 So, you know, in this case it\\'s a little 14 difficult to figure out what the alternative article of 15 manufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court even 16 before the trial judge, they never even suggested what 17 the article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent, 18 the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is not 20 helpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder is 21 knows what the determination must -- what determination 22 must be made. The factors are helpful in making the 23 determination. 24 Now what you just said about the article of 25 manufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n51 1 applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said? 2 MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury is 3 quoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in 1872 4 decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufacture 5 is the thing to which the design is applied for purposes 6 of sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing, 7 attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to find 8 out -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physical 10 sense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'s 11 what the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s applied 12 to the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it in 13 a different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- where 15 is the design applied? Is it applied to the inside? 16 No. It\\'s applied to the outside. 17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, by 18 definition, applies to the outside. It has to apply to 19 something that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say what 21 it\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms of 22 the physical world, so what is -- what are you talking 23 about? 24 MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked to 25 decide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n52 1 this was a patentable design and you find under Gorham 2 that it was infringed, what is the thing to which that 3 design was applied to give it a pleasing appearance. 4 Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or the 5 software. It is applied to the phone. Now, they could 6 if they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to the 7 jury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to the 9 outside of the phone. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to the 12 outside of an article. It has to be applied to the 13 outside of an article. 14 I see my time is expired. Thank you very 15 much. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 17 Miss Sullivan. Four minutes. 18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that 23 all apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'t 24 apportion the value of the design in relation to the 25 article. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n53 1 not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article from 2 the other articles that make up the product. So we can 3 segregate article from other articles within the 4 product. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do 5 that because it allows total profit only from that 6 article of manufacture to which the design has applied. 7 Now, the test that we ask the Court to 8 announce on remand. As has been discussed, it has two 9 parts. 10 The first is -- the antecedent question is 11 identify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimes 12 that will be very easy if you do it from two main 13 factors. What does the patent scope claim, a front 14 face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? 15 And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the 16 instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we 17 actually asked the jury to be told that where the 18 article of manufacture is a case or external housing, 19 that\\'s the article of manufacture. 20 The second question is quantum of profits. 21 And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying 22 that a lot of the expert determinations about how much 23 did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into 24 play, as the government said and we agree, only at the 25 second question: What is the quantum of profits from\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 the right article of manufacture?\\n\\n54\\n\\n2 But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar\\n\\n3 are we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n4 you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency\\n\\n5 among juries.\\n\\n6 We think the answer to the first question\\n\\n7 can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus\\n\\n8 mainly on two factors: What does the design in the\\n\\n9 patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the\\n\\n10 front face? And second, what is the product to which it\\n\\n11 has been applied? That will help judges to guide\\n\\n12 juries.\\n\\n13 We think we should have had instruction\\n\\n14 42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary\\n\\n15 judgment that the article of manufacture is the front\\n\\n16 face, and that could be instructed to the jury.\\n\\n17 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, is\\n\\n18 that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though\\n\\n19 they only want to apply it to the front.\\n\\n20 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem in\\n\\n22 the case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed to\\n\\n23 the brief I did point to -- that history is matters\\n\\n24 here, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponent\\n\\n25 product.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n55 1 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell the 3 jury that there is that distinction, I think you either 4 disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you 5 create the kind of absurd results that your brief is 6 full of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for. 7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked at 9 page 23, and it says that seems to do it. 10 MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with page 23 of 11 the tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why you 12 must remand in this case. 13 This case was tried under the improper rule 14 of law. We tried at every juncture to get the correct 15 rule of law adopted. And the district court said, I 16 forbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re not 17 asking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article of 18 manufacture. And we were shut down over and over again 19 on that. 20 So you must remand and tell the nation\\'s 21 economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on 22 a portion of a front face of an electronic device and 23 come in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juries 24 should be instructed that the article of manufacture 25 either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary\\n\\n56\\n\\n2 articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon\\n\\n3 might be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,\\n\\n4 but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the\\n\\n5 spoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the\\n\\n6 spoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,\\n\\n7 that\\'s all right.\\n\\n8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of\\n\\n9 showing what is the relevant article? I assume in a\\n\\n10 case like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.\\n\\n11 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave\\n\\n12 you with the most important disagreement we have with\\n\\n13 the government and with Apple, the burden is on the\\n\\n14 plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what\\n\\n15 the article of manufacture is.\\n\\n16 Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiff\\n\\n17 to show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in\\n\\n18 what the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\n19 burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal\\n\\n20 Circuit shows. With respect, we request that you\\n\\n21 remand -- vacate and remand.\\n\\n22 Thank you very much, Your Honor.\\n\\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n24 The case is

       "' 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\\'ll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case No. 15-777, Samsung 5 Electronics v. Apple, Incorporated. 6 Ms. Sullivan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 A smartphone is smart because it contains 12 hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it 13 work. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of 14 the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design 15 patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to 16 total profit on the entire phone. 17 That result makes no sense. A single design 18 patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone 19 should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the 20 profit on the entire phone. 21 Section 289 does not require that result, 22 and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, 23 Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does 24 not require that result. We respectfully ask that the 25 Court hold that when a design patent claims a design\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n4 1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a component 2 of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, 3 when a design patent is applied to an article of 4 manufacture within a multi-article product, we request 5 that you hold that Section 289 entitles the 6 patent-holder to total profit on the article of 7 manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and 8 not the profits on the total product. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how to 10 instruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not the 11 government, both parties kind of leave it up and say, 12 oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simply 13 wouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test. 14 My preference, if -- if I were just making 15 another sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies to 16 see how the -- the extent to which the design affected 17 the consumer, and then the jury would have something to 18 do that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlong 19 into the statute. 20 You can\\'t really have apportionment, so it 21 seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to 22 have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example 23 that\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is 24 a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and 25 just follow the words of the statute. But it seems to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s one\\n\\n4 thing to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --\\n\\n5 if I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do under\\n\\n6 your brief.\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not propose\\n\\n8 a test that simply leaves it to the jury without\\n\\n9 guidance. The instruction we proposed and that was\\n\\n10 rejected by the district court appears in the blue brief\\n\\n11 at page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that\\n\\n12 the article of manufacture to which a design has been\\n\\n13 applied is the part or portion of the product as sold\\n\\n14 that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the\\n\\n15 patent.\\n\\n16 So, Justice Kennedy, our test is very\\n\\n17 simple.\\n\\n18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I just\\n\\n19 don\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the jury\\n\\n20 room; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.\\n\\n21 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what we\\n\\n22 respectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the\\n\\n23 test for what constitutes an article of manufacture.\\n\\n24 And to be clear, I\\'m now stressing our\\n\\n25 article-of-manufacture argument, not the causation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 argument we gave as an alternative.\\n\\n6\\n\\n2 As the case comes to the Court, all we ask\\n\\n3 is that you rule in favor of us on article of\\n\\n4 manufacture.\\n\\n5 And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us\\n\\n6 what to look at --\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly make\\n\\n8 sure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --\\n\\n9 you\\'re saying we should only look to what an article of\\n\\n10 manufacture is and not your other argument that there\\n\\n11 should be apportionment as to any particular article of\\n\\n12 manufacture.\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n14 We\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the\\n\\n15 case, that a jury should be instructed that total profit\\n\\n16 must be profit derived from the article of manufacture\\n\\n17 to which the design has been applied.\\n\\n18 And, Your Honor, the statute does support\\n\\n19 our test because the statute asks us to look at the\\n\\n20 article of manufacture to which the design has been\\n\\n21 applied.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that in\\n\\n23 this -- in this case?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case it\\n\\n25 is -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n7 1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-cornered 2 front face of a phone. 3 In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular, 4 round-cornered front face of the phone with certain 5 aspect ratio and corner radii. 6 In the D\\'305, it is the display screen on 7 which the graphical user interface appears. 8 So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question, 9 the jury should have been instructed either with our 10 instruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to the 11 jury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article of 12 manufacture here, but it may be less than the entire 13 phone. The article of manufacture may be a part or 14 portion of the phone, and you should look at two things, 15 Your Honor. 16 You should look at the patent, and, Justice 17 Kennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look at 18 the -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought to 19 look at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patent 20 is going to be the best guide to what the design is 21 applied to in many, many cases, as in this case. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seem 23 to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of 24 law, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matter 25 of law.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n8 1 I believe that your basic argument, everyone 2 is in agreement, that the test is an article of 3 manufacture for purposes of sale. 4 But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how 5 do we announce the right test for that? Because the 6 phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer 7 as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. That 8 might be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know. 9 Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how to 10 figure out the component part. I don\\'t know where in 11 the record you would have enough to survive your 12 argument. 13 MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me back 14 up and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence. 15 The -- the test -- and I want to agree with 16 Your Honor. To be clear, we say that what the Federal 17 Circuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrong 18 as a matter of law to hold that the entire product is 19 necessarily the article of manufacture from which you 20 measure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law, 21 but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has to 22 hold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law. 23 It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question of 24 either fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrel 25 question of law and fact.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n9 1 And why does it involve both? Because we 2 know that district courts look at patents. You assign 3 them that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. And 4 when they look at a patent for a claim construction, 5 we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar. 6 The district court can look at the patent 7 and say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. This 8 isn\\'t one of Apple\\'s 13 other patents on other parts of 9 the phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of the 10 entire case. This is the front face patent. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how would 12 you determine the profit attributable to the relevant 13 article of manufacture? 14 MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor. 15 First, through ordinary accounting that 16 would look to the cost of goods sold in relation to 17 revenues for the relevant component. 18 You could look, if -- if a company buys the 19 component from an original equipment manufacturer, you 20 would look to their profit margins and apply that. 21 If, as sometimes happens within a company, 22 one division makes the glass front face and another 23 division makes the innards of the phone, you would find 24 out the transfer pricing between the divisions. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n10 1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent on 2 the inner parts and a hundred million was spent on the 3 face, then it\\'s a 10:1 ratio. 4 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, Your 5 Honor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have expert 7 testimony on all of that. 8 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would. 9 And you would -- but that\\'s just one way. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you had 11 a case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some of 14 the briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle 15 design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of 16 genius and it identified the car. Then it seems to me 17 that that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give three 18 days\\' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop 19 the motor. 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s what 21 we would do with the Beetle. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- it 23 seems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing. 24 MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. To 25 answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n11 1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the 2 total profit from the relevant article of manufactures 3 here, the front face, or the display screen. One could 4 have been accounting. One could have been consumer 5 demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested. 6 Apple could have said well, people really like the front 7 face disproportionately to all the other parts of the 8 phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence 9 to prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence or 10 indirect evidence through consumer survey. But, Your 11 Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total 12 profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be 13 a substantial part of the total profit on the product. 14 Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool, 15 shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. 16 It may be that the article of manufacture to which the 17 design patent is applied is just the exterior body of 18 the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay 19 much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle. 20 They want to pay for the cool way it looks. 21 If that\\'s so, it should be open to the 22 patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come 23 from the exterior of the car. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference in 25 practical terms between that and your causation argument\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 or apportionment?\\n\\n12\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concede\\n\\n5 under article of manufacture that the holder of the\\n\\n6 patent gets profit from the article, even if the profit\\n\\n7 does not come entirely from the design.\\n\\n8 Let me give you an example with a phone\\'s\\n\\n9 front face. Consumers may value the front face because\\n\\n10 it\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,\\n\\n11 because it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give the\\n\\n12 patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all\\n\\n13 the profits for the front face, even if it includes\\n\\n14 profit from those non-design features of the front face,\\n\\n15 where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test\\n\\n16 would limit the profits to the profits from the design\\n\\n17 parts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,\\n\\n18 that\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting a\\n\\n19 little more with article of manufacture than we do with\\n\\n20 a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy\\n\\n21 for that.\\n\\n22 But the reason we think it\\'s consistent with\\n\\n23 Congress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress\\n\\n24 was trying to do was provide a rule that gives\\n\\n25 design-patent holders total profit from the article of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 manufacture.\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 That\\'s a little bit overinclusive, because\\n\\n3 if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue\\n\\n4 in the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from the\\n\\n5 design, and there will be a little extra you\\'re getting\\n\\n6 perhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress\\n\\n7 was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say\\n\\n8 that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say\\n\\n9 that design causes value in a single article product\\n\\n10 like a rug.\\n\\n11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at this\\n\\n12 record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole\\n\\n13 phone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, they\\n\\n14 were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --\\n\\n15 this was their argument to the jury and it sold the\\n\\n16 Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,\\n\\n17 that, you know, all smartphones basically function the\\n\\n18 same. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.\\n\\n19 This is what they were arguing, and they put on an\\n\\n20 expert that gave total profits. If the jury credited\\n\\n21 them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a\\n\\n22 properly instructed jury, could you overturn that\\n\\n23 finding?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back to\\n\\n25 the proper instruction. The jury was not properly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 instructed here.\\n\\n14\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,\\n\\n3 Miss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. If\\n\\n5 the article of manufacture was the entire ornamental\\n\\n6 appearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on\\n\\n7 the entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assert\\n\\n8 it here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone\\n\\n9 does not look substantially similar to the entire\\n\\n10 outside of a Samsung phone. The reason why design\\n\\n11 patencies carve the product up into multiple partial\\n\\n12 design claims is so they can make a narrow infringement\\n\\n13 argument and find a little sliver of the phone on which\\n\\n14 infringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate to\\n\\n15 give total profit when they do that.\\n\\n16 So, Your Honor, if there had been a design\\n\\n17 patent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple\\n\\n18 could have tried to get total profit on the entire case.\\n\\n19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\\n\\n20 \"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properly\\n\\n21 instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case\\n\\n22 could not have found for Apple. Is that what --\\n\\n23 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n24 That is very much our position.\\n\\n25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the jury\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 instruction, what was the legal error?\\n\\n15\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in the\\n\\n3 jury instruction --\\n\\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides a\\n\\n5 properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor\\n\\n6 of Apple on the evidence presented?\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,\\n\\n8 because --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides the\\n\\n10 jury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a proper\\n\\n11 instruction was given -- what would have been the legal\\n\\n12 error?\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- no\\n\\n14 reasonable jury could have found on this record that the\\n\\n15 entire product was the article of manufacture to which\\n\\n16 the design has been applied. Two reasons.\\n\\n17 One, design patents cover ornamental\\n\\n18 appearance. They cannot, by definition, cover the\\n\\n19 innards of the phone. So the functional innards of the\\n\\n20 phone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design\\n\\n21 patent.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claim\\n\\n23 the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover the\\n\\n24 innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find\\n\\n25 its -- could find that the consumers and others would\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n16 1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks 2 only. 3 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talking 4 about design patents, not trademark or copyright. 5 There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here on 6 the -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree with 8 you, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answer 10 your question as precisely as I can. Just because you 11 can show that most of the profit comes from the Beetle 12 exterior does not mean the car is the article of 13 manufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test. 14 First, determine what is the article of 15 manufacture. 16 Then second step, determine the quantum of 17 damages, quantum of profits in this case, from that 18 article. 19 Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almost 20 all its profits from the exterior case, people were 21 indifferent to whether they could read their e-mail, 22 navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If you 23 could prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'t 24 happen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvette 25 or the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n17 1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion of 2 the total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at the 4 trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article 5 less than the whole phone? 6 MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. And 7 we were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the jury 8 instruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began, 9 we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket 1322. We said 10 very clearly article of manufacture is less than the 11 total phone and profit should be limited to the profit 12 from the article. We said again in the jury 13 instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully 14 to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on 15 petition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to the 16 court and we said please listen to us about article of 17 manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the 18 article. The district court said, no, I already said no 19 apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no 20 apportionment, she shut us out of both theories. The 21 district court shut us out of article of manufacture as 22 the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of 23 causation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here. 24 So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, our 25 charge conference. And then again in our 50A and the\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n18 1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again 2 said article is separate from apportionment, and the 3 article here is less than the phone. At 197 we said 4 at -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is less 5 than the phone. And in the 50B at the close of the 6 first trial, we again said article is less than the 7 phone. 8 Second trial happens on certain phones. 9 Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says 10 again, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment for 11 design patents. You cannot talk to me about article of 12 manufacture. We tried over and over and over again to 13 get the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and we 14 were rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor? 15 Because there was evidence in the case from which a 16 reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found 17 that the components were the front face, the front face, 18 and the display screen. And the evidence came out of 19 Apple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled to 20 rely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again and 21 again said what are you claiming. And when the 22 witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'t 23 say the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'re 24 claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, 25 ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n19 1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore 2 everything that\\'s outside the dotted lines. 3 And if I could just remind you that we\\'ve 4 reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look 5 like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D\\'677. They may 6 look like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was in 7 Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. 8 The claim is for the small portion of the external 9 appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. 10 Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. It 11 disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. 12 And Your Honor, the question for the jury 13 was not did people think that the look and feel of an 14 iPhone was great. The question for the jury was did the 15 very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes 16 look substantially similar to the very small portion of 17 the patent claim? 18 Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in 19 this record for a conclusion that the entire product, 20 profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit 21 from those articles. What Apple should have done is 22 done either of the two things we discussed earlier, 23 accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goods 24 sold on the components, or it should have done consumer 25 survey evidence like our expert did.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n20 1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General has 2 proposed a test with four factors to determine the 3 article question. Do you agree with those? Are there 4 others you would add? 5 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answer 6 briefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time. 7 We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test. 8 We propose a briefer test that we think is more 9 administrable. We propose that you look to two factors: 10 The design in the patent and the accused product. We 11 think our test is more administrable, and it can often 12 be done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do in 13 Markman, who will then instruct the jury and give them 14 guidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further on 15 rebuttal. Thank you very much. 16 I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time, 17 Mr. Chief Justice. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 Mr. Fletcher. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER 21 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 22 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 24 and may it please the Court: 25 This case presents two related questions\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 about the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for\\n\\n21\\n\\n2 design-patent infringement under Section 289. If I\\n\\n3 understood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentation\\n\\n4 correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both\\n\\n5 of those legal questions.\\n\\n6 Just to summarize briefly, first, the court\\n\\n7 of appeals correctly held that Section 289\\'s provision\\n\\n8 for an award of total profits means that the\\n\\n9 patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the\\n\\n10 sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not\\n\\n11 just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder\\n\\n12 can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as\\n\\n13 opposed to other features of the article.\\n\\n14 But second, we read the court of appeals\\'\\n\\n15 opinion to have held that the relevant article of\\n\\n16 manufacture for which profits are owed is always the\\n\\n17 entire product that the infringer sells to customers.\\n\\n18 And we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand all\\n\\n19 parties to agree with that now.\\n\\n20 Instead, the relevant article of manufacture\\n\\n21 to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes\\n\\n22 be a part or a component of a larger product sold in\\n\\n23 commerce. And when that is the case, all parties now\\n\\n24 agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the\\n\\n25 profits from that infringing article and not to all --\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n22 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when the 2 component -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t sold 3 apart from the entire product, how should the -- the 4 judge charge the jury on determining the profit 5 attributable to the infringing article? 6 MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d be 7 two factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed. 8 The first one would be what is the relevant article, and 9 there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case. 10 The second question, once the fact-finder 11 identifies the relevant article, is the question that 12 you asked, which is how much of the total profits from 13 the device are attributable to the infringing article? 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step, 15 and how do you figure it out? 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he complete 17 his answer to my question? 18 MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on the 19 second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a 20 lot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in this 21 case. This case sort of stopped at the first step. But 22 we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that 23 courts have handled other analogous questions, and I 24 point to two areas of law where that\\'s happened. 25 The first is utility patent damages under\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n23 1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the 2 infringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often a 3 patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in 4 commerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitled 5 to the profits that are attributable to the infringing 6 part, but not the whole machine. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- Justice 8 Ginsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her, 9 adequately summarized, the test that you propose at 10 page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include? 11 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test we 12 propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions 13 that I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article of 14 manufacture to which the design has been applied? Once 15 the fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the test 16 that we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to be 17 Justice Sotomayor\\'s question. 18 I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking 19 once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article 20 is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on 21 the car, how do they separate out the part of the 22 profits that are attributable to that component from the 23 whole. 24 And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefed 25 it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n24 1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that 2 courts have confronted in other areas of law. One was 3 utility patent damages, as I described. Another one is 4 discussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in the 5 Sheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a case 6 where the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses be 8 called on in order to show part one or part two or both? 9 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very often 10 both. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would those 12 expert witnesses -- who would they be? What would they 13 say? 14 MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will depend 15 on -- on the circumstances of the case. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case. 17 MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someone 18 familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in 19 the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone 20 company, or someone who is familiar with the market for 21 smartphones and who could speak to on the first question 22 how smartphones are put together, how they are 23 manufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extent 24 to which the components of a smartphone are separable. 25 And then on the second question, the one\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n25 1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be 3 speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in 4 your question in the Sullivan, which is things like 5 consumer surveys, to what extent do the various 6 components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and 7 contribute to the value of the phone. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the 9 things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. I 10 don\\'t understand how that helps on this question. It 11 would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it 12 contributed to profits. 13 MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits from 16 the bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each of 17 these components, and then what share of the revenue is 18 attributable to each of these components. And then you 19 say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up 21 calculation and try to do it that way. 22 Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimes 23 that won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation and 25 said the total profits on this product are $10 million,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26 1 and we think that the component at issue here, based on 2 expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 3 25 percent. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said based 5 on expert testimony. What would -- what would they be 6 talking about? 7 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldon 8 case that\\'s cited on page 27 of our brief from this 9 Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these 10 problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion 11 the portion -- the profits from a movie that are 12 attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or 13 the directors or other things. And they had experts who 14 were familiar with the industry and who said the script 15 is important but, really, a lot of the value and 16 particularly for a movie like this comes from other 17 things. 18 And there were various expert testimonies 19 that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up 20 saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of 21 the total profits from the movie, and this Court 22 affirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonable 23 approximation. 24 We\\'re not -- never going to be able to get 25 to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable\\n\\n27\\n\\n2 approximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly better\\n\\n3 than awarding all or nothing. And courts have been able\\n\\n4 to come to those reasonable approximations by using\\n\\n5 expert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'ve\\n\\n6 discussed.\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could you\\n\\n8 speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I\\n\\n9 understand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, that\\n\\n10 distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'s\\n\\n11 just -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body of\\n\\n12 the car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a real\\n\\n13 question as to whether it is being -- the design is\\n\\n14 being applied to the car itself.\\n\\n15 So how would you go about thinking about\\n\\n16 that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and\\n\\n17 under what instructions?\\n\\n18 MR. FLETCHER: So we think the basic\\n\\n19 question for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article of\\n\\n20 manufacture to which the design has been applied. We\\n\\n21 think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'s\\n\\n22 observation in Gorham. It\\'s 1871, first design patent\\n\\n23 case that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thing\\n\\n24 that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of\\n\\n25 manufacture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n28 1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bug 2 example is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be very 3 easy. If the patented design is for a refrigerator 4 latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the 5 distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk about 7 the hard cases. 8 MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases, 9 like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s either 10 the body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court four 11 factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the 12 jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those 13 factors. And so we say you should compare the scope of 14 the patented design as shown in the drawings in the 15 patent, how prominently that design features in the 16 accused article, whether there are other conceptually 17 distinct innovations or components in the article that 18 are not part of or associated with the patented design, 19 and finally the physical relationship between the 20 patented design and the rest of the article. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, how 22 would you decide the Beetle case, or what experts would 23 you want to hear? 24 MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- as 25 to the article, what\\'s the article --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n29 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given you 2 that second option. 3 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s a 4 factual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear from 5 experts who can speak to the question of how is the 6 Beetle put together, and what other parts of the -- the 7 Beetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetle 9 put together? It\\'s put together like every other car. 10 I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whether 11 the shape of the body is distinctive or not. 12 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also want 13 to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that 14 the scope of the claim design covers the whole article, 15 but not the interior of the car. There are design 16 features in the interior that the driver sees that 17 aren\\'t the body of the article. 18 As to the second factor, how prominent is 19 the design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts in 20 favor of finding that the design does cover the whole 21 article. 22 Then the third one is conceptually distinct 23 innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way. 24 There are going to be lots of other features of the car 25 or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 system, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you\\n\\n30\\n\\n2 might want to hear adverse testimony.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the first\\n\\n4 part of the test.\\n\\n5 MR. FLETCHER: Correct.\\n\\n6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article of\\n\\n7 manufacture.\\n\\n8 So now take the second part of the test and\\n\\n9 apply it to the Bug.\\n\\n10 MR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'ve\\n\\n11 decided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug\\n\\n12 is just the body of the Bug.\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\\n\\n14 MR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question is\\n\\n15 the best way to determine that, at least that I can\\n\\n16 think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed\\n\\n17 to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their\\n\\n18 purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and\\n\\n19 to what extent are they instead valuing other things\\n\\n20 like --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that that\\n\\n22 question is not relevant to the first question. In\\n\\n23 other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs\\n\\n24 buy them because of the look of the car.\\n\\n25 MR. FLETCHER: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'s 2 only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, 3 which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or the 4 whole car that the design is being applied to? 5 MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s the 6 statute -- the way the statute reads. It says you get 7 profits from the article of manufacture. And so, 8 logically, I think the way to approach it would be 9 identify the article and then let the patent-holder make 10 the argument that even though the article may be just a 11 part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s just 12 the case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sells 13 it. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder, 14 in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'s 15 selling the whole product, still recover a very 16 substantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is not 20 helpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought that 21 nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like 22 the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think, 23 $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What 24 if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? 25 What if it broke down every 50 miles?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32 1 So if that is a real question, if it is a 2 real question whether the article of manufacture there 3 is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about 4 the test for determining what is the article of 5 manufacture. 6 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that those 7 things can be taken into account at the second step of 8 the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the 9 relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car, 10 but for all of the reasons you just pointed out. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- you 12 were saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficult 13 question. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors to 14 determine what is the article of manufacture there. 15 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think if 16 you\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test for 17 article of manufacture also lets some of those 18 considerations play into that test, because it gets to 19 whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions, 20 or other components of the product unrelated to the 21 design. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33 1 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 2 and may it please the Court: 3 Before I address the Court\\'s many questions 4 initiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jury 5 be instructed under what we and the government believe 6 to be the relevant question -- that is, the factual test 7 of whether the relevant article of manufacture is the 8 article as sold or a distinct component of it -- and I 9 think it\\'s very clear to address the questions that 10 Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, and 11 Ms. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened in 12 this case. 13 There is no -- whatever you determine the 14 right instruction should be, there is no basis to 15 overturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case. 16 There were two trials below. In neither 17 trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or 18 witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any 19 article of manufacture other than the phones themselves. 20 In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner, 21 calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones 22 themselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable juror 23 in these trials could possibly have awarded total 24 profits on anything other than the phones, unless this 25 Court holds --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n34 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because the 2 district judge limited them? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happened 4 was, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s a 5 pretrial statement that the parties have to file saying, 6 these are -- the phones are the -- the phones were 7 infringed. The phones are the things that were 8 infringed for purposes of sale, and here is what our 9 evidence is on total profits from the phone. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on this 11 point. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question 12 trying to figure out what the standard is. Now, why 13 can\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your 14 arguments and theirs, and work it out? 15 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not a 16 difficult -- the record in this case is not difficult. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'s 18 difficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'s 21 difficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side. 22 So if I go through and come to the 23 conclusion, at least, that each side has a good 24 argument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focus 25 on the question that is of great importance across\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35 1 industries and leave the application of that and whether 2 it was properly raised to the lower courts? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this were 4 difficult, it would be entirely appropriate for this 5 Court simply to announce what the law is, which I think 6 there is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'re 7 not suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'t 8 necessary for the Court to do it. 9 This is a case very much like global tech, 10 when you found that the lower court had applied the 11 wrong standard for intentional infringement, and then 12 found that the record -- even -- but under the correct 13 higher standard, the record admitted no other 14 conclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that they 15 never identified to the jury, in either case, any 16 article of manufacture other than the phone. And all of 17 their evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based on 18 the total profits to the phone. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'ll 20 read it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question on 23 the general issue, which I think is tough. And the 24 general question that I have is I have been looking for 25 a standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n36 1 quite close; the parties actually in the government are 2 fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the 3 Internet Association, the software industry. And you 4 know that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and some 5 others. 6 MR. WAXMAN: I do. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did is 8 they went back into history. They have a lot of 9 different cases which they base the standard on, and 10 they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague, 11 but that the design where it\\'s been applied to only 12 part -- it\\'s on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product 13 and does not drive demand for the entire product, the 14 article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only 15 the component to which the design applies. And only 16 profit attributable to that component may be awarded. 17 Now, really, to understand it, you have to 18 have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to 19 understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use 20 examples. And so that kind of standard, with perhaps 21 examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper, 22 you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on the 23 hood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit from 24 the car. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n37 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not? 2 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand your 3 question, and I just want to bookmark the fact that I 4 have not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s 5 question. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead and 7 answer her question. At some point you can come back to 8 it. 9 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer Justice 10 Ginsburg first and then Justice Breyer. 11 Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that 12 Samsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened in 13 the Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report, 14 Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed to 15 present evidence about that -- about the value of design 16 to the total product as a whole. That was 17 apportionment, Judge Koh said. 18 He wanted -- he calculated total profits 19 based on the phone. And his report then said, well, but 20 I believe that only 1 percent of the value of the phone 21 is due to the design or the design of the iconic front 22 face of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him to 23 do because that was apportionment. 24 The question -- the only issue with respect 25 to article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n38 1 either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as a 2 matter of law in a multicomponent product, the article 3 of manufacture must be the portion. 4 They never said that to the jury. They did 5 propose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed the 6 jury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It also 7 directed the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'t 8 approve it. Now, it just so happens that they preserved 9 no relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'re 11 spending an awful lot of time on an issue about what was 12 raised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raised 13 below, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time to 14 turn to Justice Breyer\\'s question. 15 MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to do 16 that. 17 Justice Breyer, the -- there is no question 18 that in an appropriate case the jury can decide whether 19 the article of manufacture to which the design is 20 applied and to which it provides a distinctive and 21 pleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'s 22 actually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers, 23 or it could be a component of it. 24 In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'s 25 really not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n39 1 there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question of 2 fact for the jury. 3 We believe that the -- the four factors that 4 the Solicitor General articulated would be appropriate 5 factors to consider. 6 I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the 8 question of fact? 9 MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to which 11 the law applies? What -- what is the question of fact? 12 MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In a 13 case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing 14 articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should 15 be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find 16 infringement, total profits are awarded on the article 17 of manufacture to which the patented design was applied 18 for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar 19 or distinctive appearance. 20 You may determine that the article of 21 manufacture is the entire product or a distinct 22 component of that product. In making that 23 determination, you may consider, and this would depend 24 on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would 25 include the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n40 1 things. For example, most importantly the identity of 2 what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers. 3 Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers 4 to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 5 patentee\\'s product. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m not 7 grasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to me 8 that the design is applied to the exterior case of the 9 phone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips and 10 wires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And, 14 you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent on 15 something that the consumer can\\'t see. And yet 16 Congress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entire 19 price of the phone. 20 MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded on 21 the article of manufacture to which the design is 22 applied. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, the 24 case is part of it. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n41 1 think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s important 2 to understand that design is not a component and the 3 patented design is not the article of manufacture. The 4 patented design is something that\\'s applied to an 5 article of manufacture. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, 7 these -- these little, the chips and all are articles of 8 manufacture, right? How is the design of the case 9 applied to those chips? 10 MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, if 11 you look at, for example, in the early days, when the 12 patent -- when the design -- when design patents were 13 first permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 of 15 them were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines and 16 things like that. Congress -- when Congress said that 17 you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson 18 cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is 19 infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not 20 happen innocently. 21 When there is infringement of a design, the 22 patentee may choose an alternative remedy which is 23 essentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoes 24 of the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge the 25 profits from the article to which the design was\\n\\n\\n\\x0c1 applied.\\n\\n\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 There\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plenty\\n\\n3 of working components, but a design is not a component.\\n\\n4 A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to\\n\\n5 decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either\\n\\n6 a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape\\n\\n7 of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude\\n\\n8 that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW\\n\\n9 Beetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the\\n\\n10 Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer\\n\\n11 copied it.\\n\\n12 The -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documents\\n\\n13 in this case, for example, that are recounted in our\\n\\n14 brief, Samsung realized that it faced what this\\n\\n15 executive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of\\n\\n16 design was reflected, the documents show, in the\\n\\n17 telephone company saying, you have to create something\\n\\n18 like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create\\n\\n19 something like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing\\n\\n20 sales. And in three months --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we go\\n\\n22 back to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far your\\n\\n23 test has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'s\\n\\n24 going towards. Okay.\\n\\n25 They suggest two things. Article of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n43 1 manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have a 2 four-part test. Do you agree that that four-part test 3 with respect to identifying just the article of 4 manufacture? 5 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveat 6 only. What -- the factors that the jury will be told 7 will depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go to 9 the -- to the record. 10 MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'m 11 sticking with the test. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s the 13 test. 14 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, because 16 it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody 17 else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, 18 are the article of manufacture. 19 Now, the government would say, go to the 20 second test, which takes in some of the things that you 21 were talking about, to figure out how much of the 22 profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to 23 the shape of the car. 24 Now, as Justice Alito said, some people 25 don\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44 1 just a small car. They want the car that has a certain 2 trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. 3 Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s 4 90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body 5 accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 6 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape 7 of the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis? 8 That\\'s what I understand the government\\'s 9 analysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be told 10 to do, to decide how much value the design is to the 11 product being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in a 12 nutshell. 13 MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a test 14 that the government has articulated here at oral 15 argument. It has not been briefed by anybody. 16 The issue of how you calculate total profits 17 on something less than the whole article as sold was 18 wrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit in 19 the second Piano case, where in the second Piano case, 20 the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test, 21 how do you determine what the article of manufacture is, 22 hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The real 23 difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the 24 profits from that article of manufacture. 25 The -- the few courts that have addressed\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 this that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I\\n\\n45\\n\\n2 think probably makes the most sense and is the least\\n\\n3 difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were\\n\\n4 the costs of producing that article, that particular\\n\\n5 subcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit margin\\n\\n6 on the product as a whole applied to that little\\n\\n7 component?\\n\\n8 Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I\\n\\n9 think that\\'s what courts have generally done. And what\\n\\n10 it underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be\\n\\n11 appropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it\\n\\n12 underscores is the very --\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get off\\n\\n14 track.\\n\\n15 MR. WAXMAN: Okay.\\n\\n16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that part\\n\\n17 of the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'re\\n\\n18 saying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The government\\n\\n19 is saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is\\n\\n20 that right?\\n\\n21 MR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct\\n\\n22 that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the\\n\\n23 total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture\\n\\n24 to which the design has been applied. That is\\n\\n25 relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n46 1 the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is 2 the product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated when 3 the jury concludes that the relevant article of 4 manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where 5 customers could choose an array of cases in which to put 6 the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out 7 total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case. 8 But the decided cases that I have seen have 9 looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what 10 were the direct costs associated with producing the 11 relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on 12 the piano as applied to that. 13 And may I just add one other point which I 14 think is still on track. The problem with that is that 15 it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress 16 was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design 17 Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters 18 and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only 19 compensation was something that could be viewed as the 20 cost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going to 21 get a 10 percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to 22 produce this little component, there would be no 23 deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency. 24 Yes, Justice Kagan. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and I\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 think that the VW example is a good example for this\\n\\n47\\n\\n2 reason -- where the thing that makes the product\\n\\n3 distinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s not\\n\\n4 been a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or\\n\\n5 some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said\\n\\n6 I just have this great idea for an appearance. But\\n\\n7 that\\'s the principal reason why the product has been\\n\\n8 successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to\\n\\n9 do all the other things that cars do, but the principal\\n\\n10 reason why the car has been successful has to do with\\n\\n11 this particular appearance, the design.\\n\\n12 As I understood the government, that does\\n\\n13 not come into the first inquiry. That does not come\\n\\n14 into the question of what is the article. It only comes\\n\\n15 into the second inquiry, which is how much of the\\n\\n16 profits are attributable to that article.\\n\\n17 Do you agree with that?\\n\\n18 MR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- I\\n\\n19 don\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test as\\n\\n20 you have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. I\\n\\n21 think that the government\\'s -- if you look at the\\n\\n22 government\\'s factors, you know, one factor is the\\n\\n23 relative prominence of the design within the product as\\n\\n24 a whole. And the government says that whether the\\n\\n25 design -- in other words, whether the design is a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n48 1 significant attribute of the entire product affecting 2 the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest 3 that the article should be the product. 4 Another factor in the government\\'s test is 5 the physical relationship between the patented design 6 and the rest of the product. In other words, as the 7 government\\'s brief says, can the user or the seller 8 physically separate it, or is it manufactured 9 separately. 10 Another factor is whether the design is 11 conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, 12 for example, a design on a book binding is different 13 from the intellectual property reflected in the 14 copyright material in the book. Those -- we agree with 15 all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, 16 you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the 17 first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence 18 of the design within the product of the whole is in 19 essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in 20 determining the article of manufacture -- whether the 21 patented design is likely to cause the consumers to 22 purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 23 patentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- I 24 can\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetle 25 example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n49 1 similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or 2 a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebody 3 who looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied the 4 iconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well say 5 that, and a jury would take that into account. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is the 7 approach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as 8 \"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word? 9 MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. And 10 if there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- what 12 word would you use to describe your approach? 13 MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the article 14 of manufacture, to which the design is applied for 15 purposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive and 16 pleasing appearance. Apportionment is what their 17 expert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying the 18 total profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions of 19 dollars, but I find that only one percent of consumers 20 buy phones because of the front face of the phone either 21 off or on. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identified 23 the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily 24 what you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'t 25 see how we can get away from that word.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n50 1 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, Justice 2 Kennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" once 3 you -- if you -- if the jury answers the question at 4 step 1 and says no, no, no, the article of manufacture 5 is the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do we 6 determine total profits from the sale of that thing? 7 You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment that 8 looks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder and 9 what is the -- you know, what is the profit margin for 10 the car or the refrigerator or something like that. 11 That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it if 12 you found it. 13 So, you know, in this case it\\'s a little 14 difficult to figure out what the alternative article of 15 manufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court even 16 before the trial judge, they never even suggested what 17 the article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent, 18 the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is not 20 helpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder is 21 knows what the determination must -- what determination 22 must be made. The factors are helpful in making the 23 determination. 24 Now what you just said about the article of 25 manufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n51 1 applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said? 2 MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury is 3 quoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in 1872 4 decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufacture 5 is the thing to which the design is applied for purposes 6 of sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing, 7 attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to find 8 out -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physical 10 sense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'s 11 what the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s applied 12 to the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it in 13 a different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- where 15 is the design applied? Is it applied to the inside? 16 No. It\\'s applied to the outside. 17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, by 18 definition, applies to the outside. It has to apply to 19 something that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say what 21 it\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms of 22 the physical world, so what is -- what are you talking 23 about? 24 MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked to 25 decide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n52 1 this was a patentable design and you find under Gorham 2 that it was infringed, what is the thing to which that 3 design was applied to give it a pleasing appearance. 4 Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or the 5 software. It is applied to the phone. Now, they could 6 if they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to the 7 jury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to the 9 outside of the phone. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to the 12 outside of an article. It has to be applied to the 13 outside of an article. 14 I see my time is expired. Thank you very 15 much. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 17 Miss Sullivan. Four minutes. 18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that 23 all apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'t 24 apportion the value of the design in relation to the 25 article. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n53 1 not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article from 2 the other articles that make up the product. So we can 3 segregate article from other articles within the 4 product. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do 5 that because it allows total profit only from that 6 article of manufacture to which the design has applied. 7 Now, the test that we ask the Court to 8 announce on remand. As has been discussed, it has two 9 parts. 10 The first is -- the antecedent question is 11 identify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimes 12 that will be very easy if you do it from two main 13 factors. What does the patent scope claim, a front 14 face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? 15 And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the 16 instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we 17 actually asked the jury to be told that where the 18 article of manufacture is a case or external housing, 19 that\\'s the article of manufacture. 20 The second question is quantum of profits. 21 And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying 22 that a lot of the expert determinations about how much 23 did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into 24 play, as the government said and we agree, only at the 25 second question: What is the quantum of profits from\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 the right article of manufacture?\\n\\n54\\n\\n2 But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar\\n\\n3 are we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n4 you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency\\n\\n5 among juries.\\n\\n6 We think the answer to the first question\\n\\n7 can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus\\n\\n8 mainly on two factors: What does the design in the\\n\\n9 patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the\\n\\n10 front face? And second, what is the product to which it\\n\\n11 has been applied? That will help judges to guide\\n\\n12 juries.\\n\\n13 We think we should have had instruction\\n\\n14 42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary\\n\\n15 judgment that the article of manufacture is the front\\n\\n16 face, and that could be instructed to the jury.\\n\\n17 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, is\\n\\n18 that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though\\n\\n19 they only want to apply it to the front.\\n\\n20 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem in\\n\\n22 the case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed to\\n\\n23 the brief I did point to -- that history is matters\\n\\n24 here, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponent\\n\\n25 product.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n55 1 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell the 3 jury that there is that distinction, I think you either 4 disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you 5 create the kind of absurd results that your brief is 6 full of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for. 7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked at 9 page 23, and it says that seems to do it. 10 MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with page 23 of 11 the tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why you 12 must remand in this case. 13 This case was tried under the improper rule 14 of law. We tried at every juncture to get the correct 15 rule of law adopted. And the district court said, I 16 forbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re not 17 asking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article of 18 manufacture. And we were shut down over and over again 19 on that. 20 So you must remand and tell the nation\\'s 21 economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on 22 a portion of a front face of an electronic device and 23 come in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juries 24 should be instructed that the article of manufacture 25 either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1 Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary\\n\\n56\\n\\n2 articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon\\n\\n3 might be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,\\n\\n4 but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the\\n\\n5 spoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the\\n\\n6 spoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,\\n\\n7 that\\'s all right.\\n\\n8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of\\n\\n9 showing what is the relevant article? I assume in a\\n\\n10 case like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.\\n\\n11 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave\\n\\n12 you with the most important disagreement we have with\\n\\n13 the government and with Apple, the burden is on the\\n\\n14 plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what\\n\\n15 the article of manufacture is.\\n\\n16 Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiff\\n\\n17 to show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in\\n\\n18 what the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\n19 burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal\\n\\n20 Circuit shows. With respect, we request that you\\n\\n21 remand -- vacate and remand.\\n\\n22 Thank you very much, Your Honor.\\n\\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n24 The case is submitted.\\n\\n25 ('"

       "'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\\'ll hear argumentfirst this morning in Case No. 15-777, SamsungElectronics v. Apple, Incorporated.Ms. Sullivan.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:A smartphone is smart because it containshundreds of thousands of the technologies that make itwork. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 ofthe Patent Act entitles the holder of a single designpatent on a portion of the appearance of the phone tototal profit on the entire phone.That result makes no sense. A single designpatent on the portion of the appearance of a phoneshould not entitle the design-patent holder to all theprofit on the entire phone.Section 289 does not require that result,and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing,Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 doesnot require that result. We respectfully ask that theCourt hold that when a design patent claims a design\\x0c1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a componentof a product, or, to use the language of Section 289,when a design patent is applied to an article ofmanufacture within a multi-article product, we requestthat you hold that Section 289 entitles thepatent-holder to total profit on the article ofmanufacture to which the design patent is applied, andnot the profits on the total product.JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how toinstruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not thegovernment, both parties kind of leave it up and say,oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simplywouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test.My preference, if -- if I were just makinganother sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies tosee how the -- the extent to which the design affectedthe consumer, and then the jury would have something todo that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlonginto the statute.You can\\'t really have apportionment, so itseems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is tohave a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder examplethat\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which isa little more difficult -- and just follow the -- andjust follow the words of the statute. But it seems to\\x0cme neither side gives us an instruction to work with.\\n\\n5\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s one\\nthing to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --\\nif I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do under\\nyour brief.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not propose\\na test that simply leaves it to the jury without\\nguidance. The instruction we proposed and that was\\nrejected by the district court appears in the blue brief\\nat page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that\\nthe article of manufacture to which a design has been\\napplied is the part or portion of the product as sold\\nthat incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the\\npatent.\\nSo, Justice Kennedy, our test is very\\nsimple.\\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I just\\ndon\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the jury\\nroom; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what we\\nrespectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the\\ntest for what constitutes an article of manufacture.\\nAnd to be clear, I\\'m now stressing our\\narticle-of-manufacture argument, not the causation\\n\\x0cargument we gave as an alternative.\\n\\n6\\nAs the case comes to the Court, all we ask\\nis that you rule in favor of us on article of\\nmanufacture.\\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us\\nwhat to look at --\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly make\\nsure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --\\nyou\\'re saying we should only look to what an article of\\nmanufacture is and not your other argument that there\\nshould be apportionment as to any particular article of\\nmanufacture.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\nWe\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the\\ncase, that a jury should be instructed that total profit\\nmust be profit derived from the article of manufacture\\nto which the design has been applied.\\nAnd, Your Honor, the statute does support\\nour test because the statute asks us to look at the\\narticle of manufacture to which the design has been\\napplied.\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that in\\nthis -- in this case?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case it\\nis -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the\\n\\x0c1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-corneredfront face of a phone.In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular,round-cornered front face of the phone with certainaspect ratio and corner radii.In the D\\'305, it is the display screen onwhich the graphical user interface appears.So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question,the jury should have been instructed either with ourinstruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to thejury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article ofmanufacture here, but it may be less than the entirephone. The article of manufacture may be a part orportion of the phone, and you should look at two things,Your Honor.You should look at the patent, and, JusticeKennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look atthe -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought tolook at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patentis going to be the best guide to what the design isapplied to in many, many cases, as in this case.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seemto be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter oflaw, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matterof law.\\x0c1 I believe that your basic argument, everyoneis in agreement, that the test is an article ofmanufacture for purposes of sale.But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, howdo we announce the right test for that? Because thephone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumeras being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. Thatmight be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know.Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how tofigure out the component part. I don\\'t know where inthe record you would have enough to survive yourargument.MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me backup and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence.The -- the test -- and I want to agree withYour Honor. To be clear, we say that what the FederalCircuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrongas a matter of law to hold that the entire product isnecessarily the article of manufacture from which youmeasure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law,but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has tohold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law.It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question ofeither fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrelquestion of law and fact.\\x0c1 And why does it involve both? Because weknow that district courts look at patents. You assignthem that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. Andwhen they look at a patent for a claim construction,we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar.The district court can look at the patentand say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. Thisisn\\'t one of Apple\\'sother patents on other parts ofthe phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of theentire case. This is the front face patent.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how wouldyou determine the profit attributable to the relevantarticle of manufacture?MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor.First, through ordinary accounting thatwould look to the cost of goods sold in relation torevenues for the relevant component.You could look, if -- if a company buys thecomponent from an original equipment manufacturer, youwould look to their profit margins and apply that.If, as sometimes happens within a company,one division makes the glass front face and anotherdivision makes the innards of the phone, you would findout the transfer pricing between the divisions.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the\\x0c1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent onthe inner parts and a hundred million was spent on theface, then it\\'s a 10:1 ratio.MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, YourHonor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have experttestimony on all of that.MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would.And you would -- but that\\'s just one way.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you hada case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some ofthe briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetledesign was done in three days, and it was a stroke ofgenius and it identified the car. Then it seems to methat that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give threedays\\' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to developthe motor.MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s whatwe would do with the Beetle.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- itseems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing.MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. Toanswer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways\\x0c1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove thetotal profit from the relevant article of manufactureshere, the front face, or the display screen. One couldhave been accounting. One could have been consumerdemand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested.Apple could have said well, people really like the frontface disproportionately to all the other parts of thephone, so they could have used consumer survey evidenceto prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence orindirect evidence through consumer survey. But, YourHonor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the totalprofit from the article of manufacture may sometimes bea substantial part of the total profit on the product.Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool,shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette.It may be that the article of manufacture to which thedesign patent is applied is just the exterior body ofthe car, but it may be that nobody really wants to paymuch for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle.They want to pay for the cool way it looks.If that\\'s so, it should be open to thepatent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits comefrom the exterior of the car.JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference inpractical terms between that and your causation argument\\x0cor apportionment?\\n\\n12\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.\\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concede\\nunder article of manufacture that the holder of the\\npatent gets profit from the article, even if the profit\\ndoes not come entirely from the design.\\nLet me give you an example with a phone\\'s\\nfront face. Consumers may value the front face because\\nit\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,\\nbecause it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give the\\npatent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all\\nthe profits for the front face, even if it includes\\nprofit from those non-design features of the front face,\\nwhere the pure apportionment test or pure causation test\\nwould limit the profits to the profits from the design\\nparts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,\\nthat\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting a\\nlittle more with article of manufacture than we do with\\na pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy\\nfor that.\\nBut the reason we think it\\'s consistent with\\nCongress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress\\nwas trying to do was provide a rule that gives\\ndesign-patent holders total profit from the article of\\n\\x0cmanufacture.\\n\\n13\\nThat\\'s a little bit overinclusive, because\\nif you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue\\nin the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from the\\ndesign, and there will be a little extra you\\'re getting\\nperhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress\\nwas entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say\\nthat it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say\\nthat design causes value in a single article product\\nlike a rug.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at this\\nrecord, and they were claiming the profits on the whole\\nphone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, they\\nwere saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --\\nthis was their argument to the jury and it sold the\\nFederal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,\\nthat, you know, all smartphones basically function the\\nsame. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.\\nThis is what they were arguing, and they put on an\\nexpert that gave total profits. If the jury credited\\nthem, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a\\nproperly instructed jury, could you overturn that\\nfinding?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back to\\nthe proper instruction. The jury was not properly\\n\\x0cinstructed here.\\n\\n14\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,\\nMiss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. If\\nthe article of manufacture was the entire ornamental\\nappearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on\\nthe entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assert\\nit here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone\\ndoes not look substantially similar to the entire\\noutside of a Samsung phone. The reason why design\\npatencies carve the product up into multiple partial\\ndesign claims is so they can make a narrow infringement\\nargument and find a little sliver of the phone on which\\ninfringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate to\\ngive total profit when they do that.\\nSo, Your Honor, if there had been a design\\npatent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple\\ncould have tried to get total profit on the entire case.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\\n\"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properly\\ninstructed jury on the evidence presented in this case\\ncould not have found for Apple. Is that what --\\nMS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\nThat is very much our position.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the jury\\n\\x0cinstruction, what was the legal error?\\n\\n15\\nMS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in the\\njury instruction --\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides a\\nproperly instructed jury, could they have found in favor\\nof Apple on the evidence presented?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,\\nbecause --\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides the\\njury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a proper\\ninstruction was given -- what would have been the legal\\nerror?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- no\\nreasonable jury could have found on this record that the\\nentire product was the article of manufacture to which\\nthe design has been applied. Two reasons.\\nOne, design patents cover ornamental\\nappearance. They cannot, by definition, cover the\\ninnards of the phone. So the functional innards of the\\nphone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design\\npatent.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claim\\nthe design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover the\\ninnards, but you just admitted that a jury could find\\nits -- could find that the consumers and others would\\n\\x0c1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looksonly.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talkingabout design patents, not trademark or copyright.There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here onthe -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree withyou, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answeryour question as precisely as I can. Just because youcan show that most of the profit comes from the Beetleexterior does not mean the car is the article ofmanufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test.First, determine what is the article ofmanufacture.Then second step, determine the quantum ofdamages, quantum of profits in this case, from thatarticle.Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almostall its profits from the exterior case, people wereindifferent to whether they could read their e-mail,navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If youcould prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'thappen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvetteor the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the\\x0c1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion ofthe total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at thetrial, propose basing damages on profits from an articleless than the whole phone?MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. Andwe were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the juryinstruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began,we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket 1322. We saidvery clearly article of manufacture is less than thetotal phone and profit should be limited to the profitfrom the article. We said again in the juryinstructions -- and here I would refer you respectfullyto joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that onpetition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to thecourt and we said please listen to us about article ofmanufacture, if you only get the total profit on thearticle. The district court said, no, I already said noapportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said noapportionment, she shut us out of both theories. Thedistrict court shut us out of article of manufacture asthe basis for total profit, and it shut us out ofcausation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here.So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, ourcharge conference. And then again in our 50A and the\\x0c1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we againsaid article is separate from apportionment, and thearticle here is less than the phone. At 197 we saidat -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is lessthan the phone. And in the 50B at the close of thefirst trial, we again said article is less than thephone.Second trial happens on certain phones.Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court saysagain, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment fordesign patents. You cannot talk to me about article ofmanufacture. We tried over and over and over again toget the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and wewere rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor?Because there was evidence in the case from which areasonable, properly instructed jury could have foundthat the components were the front face, the front face,and the display screen. And the evidence came out ofApple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled torely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again andagain said what are you claiming. And when thewitnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'tsay the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'reclaiming a very specific front face, and by the way,ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific\\x0c1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignoreeverything that\\'s outside the dotted lines.And if I could just remind you that we\\'vereprinted the patents for you to see, and they may looklike an iPhone on page 7, which is the D\\'677. They maylook like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was inBlueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone.The claim is for the small portion of the externalappearance of the phone that is inside the solid line.Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. Itdisclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines.And Your Honor, the question for the jurywas not did people think that the look and feel of aniPhone was great. The question for the jury was did thevery small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makeslook substantially similar to the very small portion ofthe patent claim?Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis inthis record for a conclusion that the entire product,profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profitfrom those articles. What Apple should have done isdone either of the two things we discussed earlier,accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goodssold on the components, or it should have done consumersurvey evidence like our expert did.\\x0c1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General hasproposed a test with four factors to determine thearticle question. Do you agree with those? Are thereothers you would add?MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answerbriefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time.We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test.We propose a briefer test that we think is moreadministrable. We propose that you look to two factors:The design in the patent and the accused product. Wethink our test is more administrable, and it can oftenbe done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do inMarkman, who will then instruct the jury and give themguidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further onrebuttal. Thank you very much.I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time,Mr. Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Fletcher.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHERFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTYMR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:This case presents two related questions\\x0cabout the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for\\n\\n21\\ndesign-patent infringement under Section 289. If I\\nunderstood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentation\\ncorrectly, the parties are now in agreement about both\\nof those legal questions.\\nJust to summarize briefly, first, the court\\nof appeals correctly held that Section 289\\'s provision\\nfor an award of total profits means that the\\npatent-holder can recover all of the profits from the\\nsale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not\\njust the portion of the profits that the patent-holder\\ncan prove was caused by or attributable to the design as\\nopposed to other features of the article.\\nBut second, we read the court of appeals\\'\\nopinion to have held that the relevant article of\\nmanufacture for which profits are owed is always the\\nentire product that the infringer sells to customers.\\nAnd we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand all\\nparties to agree with that now.\\nInstead, the relevant article of manufacture\\nto which a patented design may be applied will sometimes\\nbe a part or a component of a larger product sold in\\ncommerce. And when that is the case, all parties now\\nagree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the\\nprofits from that infringing article and not to all --\\n\\x0c1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when thecomponent -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t soldapart from the entire product, how should the -- thejudge charge the jury on determining the profitattributable to the infringing article?MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d betwo factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed.The first one would be what is the relevant article, andthere may be a dispute on that as there is in this case.The second question, once the fact-finderidentifies the relevant article, is the question thatyou asked, which is how much of the total profits fromthe device are attributable to the infringing article?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step,and how do you figure it out?JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he completehis answer to my question?MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on thesecond step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in alot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in thiscase. This case sort of stopped at the first step. Butwe think that courts could sensibly look to the way thatcourts have handled other analogous questions, and Ipoint to two areas of law where that\\'s happened.The first is utility patent damages under\\x0c1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of theinfringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often apatent would apply to part of a larger product sold incommerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitledto the profits that are attributable to the infringingpart, but not the whole machine.JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- JusticeGinsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her,adequately summarized, the test that you propose atpageof your brief relevant considerations include?MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test wepropose at pagegoes to the first of the two questionsthat I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article ofmanufacture to which the design has been applied? Oncethe fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the testthat we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to beJustice Sotomayor\\'s question.I understood Justice Ginsburg to be askingonce the fact-finder decides that the relevant articleis, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder onthe car, how do they separate out the part of theprofits that are attributable to that component from thewhole.And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefedit in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to\\x0c1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems thatcourts have confronted in other areas of law. One wasutility patent damages, as I described. Another one isdiscussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in theSheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a casewhere the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses becalled on in order to show part one or part two or both?MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very oftenboth.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would thoseexpert witnesses -- who would they be? What would theysay?MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will dependon -- on the circumstances of the case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case.MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someonefamiliar with the industry, someone who had worked inthe industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphonecompany, or someone who is familiar with the market forsmartphones and who could speak to on the first questionhow smartphones are put together, how they aremanufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extentto which the components of a smartphone are separable.And then on the second question, the one\\x0c1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could bespeaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised inyour question in the Sullivan, which is things likeconsumer surveys, to what extent do the variouscomponents of a smartphone drive consumer demand andcontribute to the value of the phone.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of thethings that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. Idon\\'t understand how that helps on this question. Itwould seem to me the higher the cost, the less itcontributed to profits.MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. ChiefJustice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits fromthe bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each ofthese components, and then what share of the revenue isattributable to each of these components. And then yousay this component ispercent of the cost and20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-upcalculation and try to do it that way.Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimesthat won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation andsaid the total profits on this product are $10 million,\\x0c1 and we think that the component at issue here, based onexpert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or25 percent.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said basedon expert testimony. What would -- what would they betalking about?MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldoncase that\\'s cited on pageof our brief from thisCourt that was a Copyright Act case but discussed theseproblems sort of generally discussed how you apportionthe portion -- the profits from a movie that areattributable to the script as opposed to the actors orthe directors or other things. And they had experts whowere familiar with the industry and who said the scriptis important but, really, a lot of the value andparticularly for a movie like this comes from otherthings.And there were various expert testimoniesthat gave varying percentages, and the Court ended upsaying that the court below had awardedpercent ofthe total profits from the movie, and this Courtaffirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonableapproximation.We\\'re not -- never going to be able to getto certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions\\x0cand these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable\\n\\n27\\napproximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly better\\nthan awarding all or nothing. And courts have been able\\nto come to those reasonable approximations by using\\nexpert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'ve\\ndiscussed.\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could you\\nspeak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I\\nunderstand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, that\\ndistinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'s\\njust -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body of\\nthe car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a real\\nquestion as to whether it is being -- the design is\\nbeing applied to the car itself.\\nSo how would you go about thinking about\\nthat question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and\\nunder what instructions?\\nMR. FLETCHER: So we think the basic\\nquestion for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article of\\nmanufacture to which the design has been applied. We\\nthink the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'s\\nobservation in Gorham. It\\'s 1871, first design patent\\ncase that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thing\\nthat gives the distinctive appearance to an article of\\nmanufacture.\\n\\x0c1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bugexample is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be veryeasy. If the patented design is for a refrigeratorlatch, no one is going to think that the latch gives thedistinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator.JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk aboutthe hard cases.MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases,like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s eitherthe body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court fourfactors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if thejury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on thosefactors. And so we say you should compare the scope ofthe patented design as shown in the drawings in thepatent, how prominently that design features in theaccused article, whether there are other conceptuallydistinct innovations or components in the article thatare not part of or associated with the patented design,and finally the physical relationship between thepatented design and the rest of the article.JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, howwould you decide the Beetle case, or what experts wouldyou want to hear?MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- asto the article, what\\'s the article --\\x0c1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given youthat second option.MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s afactual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear fromexperts who can speak to the question of how is theBeetle put together, and what other parts of the -- theBeetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetleput together? It\\'s put together like every other car.I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whetherthe shape of the body is distinctive or not.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also wantto know, to put it in terms of all four factors, thatthe scope of the claim design covers the whole article,but not the interior of the car. There are designfeatures in the interior that the driver sees thataren\\'t the body of the article.As to the second factor, how prominent isthe design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts infavor of finding that the design does cover the wholearticle.Then the third one is conceptually distinctinnovations, and I think that one cuts the other way.There are going to be lots of other features of the caror innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering\\x0csystem, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you\\n\\n30\\nmight want to hear adverse testimony.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the first\\npart of the test.\\nMR. FLETCHER: Correct.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article of\\nmanufacture.\\nSo now take the second part of the test and\\napply it to the Bug.\\nMR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'ve\\ndecided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug\\nis just the body of the Bug.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\\nMR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question is\\nthe best way to determine that, at least that I can\\nthink of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed\\nto, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their\\npurchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and\\nto what extent are they instead valuing other things\\nlike --\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that that\\nquestion is not relevant to the first question. In\\nother words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs\\nbuy them because of the look of the car.\\nMR. FLETCHER: Yes.\\n\\x0c\\n31JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'sonly relevant at questionrather than at question 1,which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or thewhole car that the design is being applied to?MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s thestatute -- the way the statute reads. It says you getprofits from the article of manufacture. And so,logically, I think the way to approach it would beidentify the article and then let the patent-holder makethe argument that even though the article may be just apart of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s justthe case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sellsit. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder,in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'sselling the whole product, still recover a verysubstantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way.JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is nothelpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought thatnobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they likethe way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think,$1800 when it was first sold in the United States? Whatif it cost $18,000? What if it gotmiles per gallon?What if it broke down every 50 miles?\\x0c\\n32So if that is a real question, if it is areal question whether the article of manufacture thereis the design or the entire car, gives me pause aboutthe test for determining what is the article ofmanufacture.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that thosethings can be taken into account at the second step ofthe test, if you decide that the relevant design -- therelevant article of manufacture is the body of the car,but for all of the reasons you just pointed out.JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- youwere saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficultquestion. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors todetermine what is the article of manufacture there.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think ifyou\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test forarticle of manufacture also lets some of thoseconsiderations play into that test, because it gets towhether there are other conceptually distinct invasions,or other components of the product unrelated to thedesign.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\\x0c\\n33MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:Before I address the Court\\'s many questionsinitiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jurybe instructed under what we and the government believeto be the relevant question -- that is, the factual testof whether the relevant article of manufacture is thearticle as sold or a distinct component of it -- and Ithink it\\'s very clear to address the questions thatJustice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, andMs. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened inthis case.There is no -- whatever you determine theright instruction should be, there is no basis tooverturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case.There were two trials below. In neithertrial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, orwitness testimony, ever identify for the jury anyarticle of manufacture other than the phones themselves.In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner,calculated total profits under 289 only on the phonesthemselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable jurorin these trials could possibly have awarded totalprofits on anything other than the phones, unless thisCourt holds --\\x0c\\n34JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because thedistrict judge limited them?MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happenedwas, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s apretrial statement that the parties have to file saying,these are -- the phones are the -- the phones wereinfringed. The phones are the things that wereinfringed for purposes of sale, and here is what ourevidence is on total profits from the phone.JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on thispoint. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough questiontrying to figure out what the standard is. Now, whycan\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to yourarguments and theirs, and work it out?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not adifficult -- the record in this case is not difficult.JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'sdifficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'sdifficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side.So if I go through and come to theconclusion, at least, that each side has a goodargument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focuson the question that is of great importance across\\x0c\\n35industries and leave the application of that and whetherit was properly raised to the lower courts?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this weredifficult, it would be entirely appropriate for thisCourt simply to announce what the law is, which I thinkthere is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'renot suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'tnecessary for the Court to do it.This is a case very much like global tech,when you found that the lower court had applied thewrong standard for intentional infringement, and thenfound that the record -- even -- but under the correcthigher standard, the record admitted no otherconclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that theynever identified to the jury, in either case, anyarticle of manufacture other than the phone. And all oftheir evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based onthe total profits to the phone.JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'llread it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you.JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question onthe general issue, which I think is tough. And thegeneral question that I have is I have been looking fora standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all\\x0c\\n36quite close; the parties actually in the government arefairly close on this -- but is in a brief for theInternet Association, the software industry. And youknow that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and someothers.MR. WAXMAN: I do.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did isthey went back into history. They have a lot ofdifferent cases which they base the standard on, andthey come to the conclusion, which is a little vague,but that the design where it\\'s been applied to onlypart -- it\\'s on page-- of a multicomponent productand does not drive demand for the entire product, thearticle of manufacture is rightly considered to be onlythe component to which the design applies. And onlyprofit attributable to that component may be awarded.Now, really, to understand it, you have tohave examples -- but antitrust cases are hard tounderstand -- and our rule of reason and people do useexamples. And so that kind of standard, with perhapsexamples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper,you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on thehood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit fromthe car.MR. WAXMAN: Justice --\\x0c\\n37JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not?MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand yourquestion, and I just want to bookmark the fact that Ihave not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'squestion.JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead andanswer her question. At some point you can come back toit.MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer JusticeGinsburg first and then Justice Breyer.Justice Ginsburg, the only thing thatSamsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened inthe Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report,Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed topresent evidence about that -- about the value of designto the total product as a whole. That wasapportionment, Judge Koh said.He wanted -- he calculated total profitsbased on the phone. And his report then said, well, butI believe that onlypercent of the value of the phoneis due to the design or the design of the iconic frontface of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him todo because that was apportionment.The question -- the only issue with respectto article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in\\x0c\\n38either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as amatter of law in a multicomponent product, the articleof manufacture must be the portion.They never said that to the jury. They didpropose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed thejury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It alsodirected the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'tapprove it. Now, it just so happens that they preservedno relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'respending an awful lot of time on an issue about what wasraised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raisedbelow, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time toturn to Justice Breyer\\'s question.MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to dothat.Justice Breyer, the -- there is no questionthat in an appropriate case the jury can decide whetherthe article of manufacture to which the design isapplied and to which it provides a distinctive andpleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'sactually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers,or it could be a component of it.In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'sreally not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,\\x0c\\n39there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question offact for the jury.We believe that the -- the four factors thatthe Solicitor General articulated would be appropriatefactors to consider.I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is thequestion of fact?MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to whichthe law applies? What -- what is the question of fact?MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In acase in which the jury heard evidence as to competingarticles of manufacture, as to what total profits shouldbe applied to, the jury would be told, if you findinfringement, total profits are awarded on the articleof manufacture to which the patented design was appliedfor the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiaror distinctive appearance.You may determine that the article ofmanufacture is the entire product or a distinctcomponent of that product. In making thatdetermination, you may consider, and this would dependon the evidence in the case, among other factors I wouldinclude the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other\\x0c\\n40things. For example, most importantly the identity ofwhat it is that is typically consumed by purchasers.Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumersto purchase the infringing product thinking it to be thepatentee\\'s product.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m notgrasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to methat the design is applied to the exterior case of thephone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips andwires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And,you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent onsomething that the consumer can\\'t see. And yetCongress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entireprice of the phone.MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded onthe article of manufacture to which the design isapplied.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, thecase is part of it.MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I\\x0c\\n41think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s importantto understand that design is not a component and thepatented design is not the article of manufacture. Thepatented design is something that\\'s applied to anarticle of manufacture.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well,these -- these little, the chips and all are articles ofmanufacture, right? How is the design of the caseapplied to those chips?MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, ifyou look at, for example, in the early days, when thepatent -- when the design -- when design patents werefirst permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 ofthem were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines andthings like that. Congress -- when Congress said thatyou are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobsoncases, that as an alternative remedy, if there isinfringement of a design -- which, by the way, does nothappen innocently.When there is infringement of a design, thepatentee may choose an alternative remedy which isessentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoesof the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge theprofits from the article to which the design was\\x0c1 applied.\\n42\\nThere\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plenty\\nof working components, but a design is not a component.\\nA design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to\\ndecide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either\\na cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape\\nof the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude\\nthat because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW\\nBeetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the\\nBeetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer\\ncopied it.\\nThe -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documents\\nin this case, for example, that are recounted in our\\nbrief, Samsung realized that it faced what this\\nexecutive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of\\ndesign was reflected, the documents show, in the\\ntelephone company saying, you have to create something\\nlike the iPhone, and a directive came out to create\\nsomething like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing\\nsales. And in three months --\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we go\\nback to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far your\\ntest has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'s\\ngoing towards. Okay.\\nThey suggest two things. Article of\\n\\x0c\\n43manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have afour-part test. Do you agree that that four-part testwith respect to identifying just the article ofmanufacture?MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveatonly. What -- the factors that the jury will be toldwill depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go tothe -- to the record.MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'msticking with the test.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s thetest.MR. WAXMAN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, becauseit makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybodyelse, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards,are the article of manufacture.Now, the government would say, go to thesecond test, which takes in some of the things that youwere talking about, to figure out how much of theprofits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable tothe shape of the car.Now, as Justice Alito said, some peopledon\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want\\x0c\\n44just a small car. They want the car that has a certaintrunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons.Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s90 percent of the profits. It may be that the bodyaccounts for onlypercent of the cost of the car, but90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shapeof the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis?That\\'s what I understand the government\\'sanalysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be toldto do, to decide how much value the design is to theproduct being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in anutshell.MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a testthat the government has articulated here at oralargument. It has not been briefed by anybody.The issue of how you calculate total profitson something less than the whole article as sold waswrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit inthe second Piano case, where in the second Piano case,the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test,how do you determine what the article of manufacture is,hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The realdifficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of theprofits from that article of manufacture.The -- the few courts that have addressed\\x0cthis that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I\\n\\n45\\nthink probably makes the most sense and is the least\\ndifficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were\\nthe costs of producing that article, that particular\\nsubcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit margin\\non the product as a whole applied to that little\\ncomponent?\\nNow, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I\\nthink that\\'s what courts have generally done. And what\\nit underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be\\nappropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it\\nunderscores is the very --\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get off\\ntrack.\\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that part\\nof the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'re\\nsaying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The government\\nis saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is\\nthat right?\\nMR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct\\nthat under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the\\ntotal profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture\\nto which the design has been applied. That is\\nrelatively straightforward when, in a contested case,\\n\\x0c\\n46the jury concludes that the article of manufacture isthe product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated whenthe jury concludes that the relevant article ofmanufacture, as was the case in the piano cases wherecustomers could choose an array of cases in which to putthe piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure outtotal profits from the manufacture and sale of the case.But the decided cases that I have seen havelooked at the question what was the manufacture -- whatwere the direct costs associated with producing therelevant piano cases and what was the profit margin onthe piano as applied to that.And may I just add one other point which Ithink is still on track. The problem with that is thatit runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congresswas concerned about in 1887 when it passed the DesignPatent Act, because the concern was that counterfeitersand copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the onlycompensation was something that could be viewed as thecost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going toget apercent margin on $2.50 for what it cost toproduce this little component, there would be nodeterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency.Yes, Justice Kagan.JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and I\\x0cthink that the VW example is a good example for this\\n\\n47\\nreason -- where the thing that makes the product\\ndistinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s not\\nbeen a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or\\nsome graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said\\nI just have this great idea for an appearance. But\\nthat\\'s the principal reason why the product has been\\nsuccessful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to\\ndo all the other things that cars do, but the principal\\nreason why the car has been successful has to do with\\nthis particular appearance, the design.\\nAs I understood the government, that does\\nnot come into the first inquiry. That does not come\\ninto the question of what is the article. It only comes\\ninto the second inquiry, which is how much of the\\nprofits are attributable to that article.\\nDo you agree with that?\\nMR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- I\\ndon\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test as\\nyou have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. I\\nthink that the government\\'s -- if you look at the\\ngovernment\\'s factors, you know, one factor is the\\nrelative prominence of the design within the product as\\na whole. And the government says that whether the\\ndesign -- in other words, whether the design is a\\n\\x0c\\n48significant attribute of the entire product affectingthe appearance of the product as a whole would suggestthat the article should be the product.Another factor in the government\\'s test isthe physical relationship between the patented designand the rest of the product. In other words, as thegovernment\\'s brief says, can the user or the sellerphysically separate it, or is it manufacturedseparately.Another factor is whether the design isconceptually different from the product as a whole, as,for example, a design on a book binding is differentfrom the intellectual property reflected in thecopyright material in the book. Those -- we agree withall those factors as relevant, but I do think directly,you know, speaking to the question that you raised, thefirst factor that I mentioned, the relative prominenceof the design within the product of the whole is inessence asking -- and it is a relevant question indetermining the article of manufacture -- whether thepatented design is likely to cause the consumers topurchase the infringing product thinking it to be thepatentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- Ican\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetleexample, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was\\x0c\\n49similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep ora Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebodywho looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied theiconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well saythat, and a jury would take that into account.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is theapproach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as\"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word?MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. Andif there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- whatword would you use to describe your approach?MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the articleof manufacture, to which the design is applied forpurposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive andpleasing appearance. Apportionment is what theirexpert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying thetotal profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions ofdollars, but I find that only one percent of consumersbuy phones because of the front face of the phone eitheroff or on.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identifiedthe relevant article, then it seems to me necessarilywhat you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'tsee how we can get away from that word.\\x0c\\n50MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, JusticeKennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" onceyou -- if you -- if the jury answers the question atstepand says no, no, no, the article of manufactureis the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do wedetermine total profits from the sale of that thing?You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment thatlooks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder andwhat is the -- you know, what is the profit margin forthe car or the refrigerator or something like that.That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it ifyou found it.So, you know, in this case it\\'s a littledifficult to figure out what the alternative article ofmanufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court evenbefore the trial judge, they never even suggested whatthe article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent,the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is nothelpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder isknows what the determination must -- what determinationmust be made. The factors are helpful in making thedetermination.Now what you just said about the article ofmanufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is\\x0c\\n51applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said?MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury isquoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in 1872decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufactureis the thing to which the design is applied for purposesof sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing,attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to findout -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physicalsense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'swhat the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s appliedto the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it ina different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- whereis the design applied? Is it applied to the inside?No. It\\'s applied to the outside.MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, bydefinition, applies to the outside. It has to apply tosomething that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say whatit\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms ofthe physical world, so what is -- what are you talkingabout?MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked todecide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that\\x0c\\n52this was a patentable design and you find under Gorhamthat it was infringed, what is the thing to which thatdesign was applied to give it a pleasing appearance.Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or thesoftware. It is applied to the phone. Now, they couldif they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to thejury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to theoutside of the phone.MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to theoutside of an article. It has to be applied to theoutside of an article.I see my time is expired. Thank you verymuch.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Miss Sullivan. Four minutes.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say thatall apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'tapportion the value of the design in relation to thearticle. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did\\x0c\\n53not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article fromthe other articles that make up the product. So we cansegregate article from other articles within theproduct. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to dothat because it allows total profit only from thatarticle of manufacture to which the design has applied.Now, the test that we ask the Court toannounce on remand. As has been discussed, it has twoparts.The first is -- the antecedent question isidentify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimesthat will be very easy if you do it from two mainfactors. What does the patent scope claim, a frontface, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing?And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for theinstruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, weactually asked the jury to be told that where thearticle of manufacture is a case or external housing,that\\'s the article of manufacture.The second question is quantum of profits.And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in sayingthat a lot of the expert determinations about how muchdid the Beetle exterior drive demand will come intoplay, as the government said and we agree, only at thesecond question: What is the quantum of profits from\\x0cthe right article of manufacture?\\n\\n54\\nBut, Justice Alito, you asked how similar\\nare we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,\\nyou asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency\\namong juries.\\nWe think the answer to the first question\\ncan be made more consistent and uniform if we focus\\nmainly on two factors: What does the design in the\\npatent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the\\nfront face? And second, what is the product to which it\\nhas been applied? That will help judges to guide\\njuries.\\nWe think we should have had instruction\\n42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary\\njudgment that the article of manufacture is the front\\nface, and that could be instructed to the jury.\\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, is\\nthat Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though\\nthey only want to apply it to the front.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem in\\nthe case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed to\\nthe brief I did point to -- that history is matters\\nhere, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponent\\nproduct.\\n\\x0c\\n55MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell thejury that there is that distinction, I think you eitherdisregard what Congress meant in its statute or youcreate the kind of absurd results that your brief isfull of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked atpage 23, and it says that seems to do it.MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with pageofthe tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why youmust remand in this case.This case was tried under the improper ruleof law. We tried at every juncture to get the correctrule of law adopted. And the district court said, Iforbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re notasking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article ofmanufacture. And we were shut down over and over againon that.So you must remand and tell the nation\\'seconomy that no one can claim a partial design patent ona portion of a front face of an electronic device andcome in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juriesshould be instructed that the article of manufactureeither is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice\\x0cBreyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary\\n\\n56\\narticles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon\\nmight be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,\\nbut nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the\\nspoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the\\nspoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,\\nthat\\'s all right.\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of\\nshowing what is the relevant article? I assume in a\\ncase like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave\\nyou with the most important disagreement we have with\\nthe government and with Apple, the burden is on the\\nplaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what\\nthe article of manufacture is.\\nWhy is that? The burden is on the plaintiff\\nto show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in\\nwhat the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'s\\nburden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal\\nCircuit shows. With respect, we request that you\\nremand -- vacate and remand.\\nThank you very much, Your Honor.\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\nThe case is submitted.\\n('"

       "'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\\'ll hear argumentfirst this morning in Case No. 15-777, SamsungElectronics v. Apple, Incorporated.Ms. Sullivan.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:A smartphone is smart because it containshundreds of thousands of the technologies that make itwork. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 ofthe Patent Act entitles the holder of a single designpatent on a portion of the appearance of the phone tototal profit on the entire phone.That result makes no sense. A single designpatent on the portion of the appearance of a phoneshould not entitle the design-patent holder to all theprofit on the entire phone.Section 289 does not require that result,and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing,Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 doesnot require that result. We respectfully ask that theCourt hold that when a design patent claims a design1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a componentof a product, or, to use the language of Section 289,when a design patent is applied to an article ofmanufacture within a multi-article product, we requestthat you hold that Section 289 entitles thepatent-holder to total profit on the article ofmanufacture to which the design patent is applied, andnot the profits on the total product.JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how toinstruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not thegovernment, both parties kind of leave it up and say,oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simplywouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test.My preference, if -- if I were just makinganother sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies tosee how the -- the extent to which the design affectedthe consumer, and then the jury would have something todo that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlonginto the statute.You can\\'t really have apportionment, so itseems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is tohave a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder examplethat\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which isa little more difficult -- and just follow the -- andjust follow the words of the statute. But it seems tome neither side gives us an instruction to work with.\\n\\n5\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s one\\nthing to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --\\nif I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do under\\nyour brief.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not propose\\na test that simply leaves it to the jury without\\nguidance. The instruction we proposed and that was\\nrejected by the district court appears in the blue brief\\nat page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that\\nthe article of manufacture to which a design has been\\napplied is the part or portion of the product as sold\\nthat incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the\\npatent.\\nSo, Justice Kennedy, our test is very\\nsimple.\\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I just\\ndon\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the jury\\nroom; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what we\\nrespectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the\\ntest for what constitutes an article of manufacture.\\nAnd to be clear, I\\'m now stressing our\\narticle-of-manufacture argument, not the causation\\nargument we gave as an alternative.\\n\\n6\\nAs the case comes to the Court, all we ask\\nis that you rule in favor of us on article of\\nmanufacture.\\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us\\nwhat to look at --\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly make\\nsure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --\\nyou\\'re saying we should only look to what an article of\\nmanufacture is and not your other argument that there\\nshould be apportionment as to any particular article of\\nmanufacture.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\nWe\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the\\ncase, that a jury should be instructed that total profit\\nmust be profit derived from the article of manufacture\\nto which the design has been applied.\\nAnd, Your Honor, the statute does support\\nour test because the statute asks us to look at the\\narticle of manufacture to which the design has been\\napplied.\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that in\\nthis -- in this case?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case it\\nis -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the\\n1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-corneredfront face of a phone.In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular,round-cornered front face of the phone with certainaspect ratio and corner radii.In the D\\'305, it is the display screen onwhich the graphical user interface appears.So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question,the jury should have been instructed either with ourinstruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to thejury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article ofmanufacture here, but it may be less than the entirephone. The article of manufacture may be a part orportion of the phone, and you should look at two things,Your Honor.You should look at the patent, and, JusticeKennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look atthe -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought tolook at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patentis going to be the best guide to what the design isapplied to in many, many cases, as in this case.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seemto be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter oflaw, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matterof law.1 I believe that your basic argument, everyoneis in agreement, that the test is an article ofmanufacture for purposes of sale.But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, howdo we announce the right test for that? Because thephone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumeras being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. Thatmight be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know.Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how tofigure out the component part. I don\\'t know where inthe record you would have enough to survive yourargument.MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me backup and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence.The -- the test -- and I want to agree withYour Honor. To be clear, we say that what the FederalCircuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrongas a matter of law to hold that the entire product isnecessarily the article of manufacture from which youmeasure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law,but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has tohold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law.It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question ofeither fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrelquestion of law and fact.1 And why does it involve both? Because weknow that district courts look at patents. You assignthem that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. Andwhen they look at a patent for a claim construction,we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar.The district court can look at the patentand say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. Thisisn\\'t one of Apple\\'sother patents on other parts ofthe phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of theentire case. This is the front face patent.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how wouldyou determine the profit attributable to the relevantarticle of manufacture?MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor.First, through ordinary accounting thatwould look to the cost of goods sold in relation torevenues for the relevant component.You could look, if -- if a company buys thecomponent from an original equipment manufacturer, youwould look to their profit margins and apply that.If, as sometimes happens within a company,one division makes the glass front face and anotherdivision makes the innards of the phone, you would findout the transfer pricing between the divisions.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent onthe inner parts and a hundred million was spent on theface, then it\\'s a 10:1 ratio.MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, YourHonor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have experttestimony on all of that.MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would.And you would -- but that\\'s just one way.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you hada case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some ofthe briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetledesign was done in three days, and it was a stroke ofgenius and it identified the car. Then it seems to methat that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give threedays\\' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to developthe motor.MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s whatwe would do with the Beetle.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- itseems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing.MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. Toanswer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove thetotal profit from the relevant article of manufactureshere, the front face, or the display screen. One couldhave been accounting. One could have been consumerdemand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested.Apple could have said well, people really like the frontface disproportionately to all the other parts of thephone, so they could have used consumer survey evidenceto prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence orindirect evidence through consumer survey. But, YourHonor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the totalprofit from the article of manufacture may sometimes bea substantial part of the total profit on the product.Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool,shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette.It may be that the article of manufacture to which thedesign patent is applied is just the exterior body ofthe car, but it may be that nobody really wants to paymuch for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle.They want to pay for the cool way it looks.If that\\'s so, it should be open to thepatent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits comefrom the exterior of the car.JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference inpractical terms between that and your causation argumentor apportionment?\\n\\n12\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.\\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concede\\nunder article of manufacture that the holder of the\\npatent gets profit from the article, even if the profit\\ndoes not come entirely from the design.\\nLet me give you an example with a phone\\'s\\nfront face. Consumers may value the front face because\\nit\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,\\nbecause it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give the\\npatent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all\\nthe profits for the front face, even if it includes\\nprofit from those non-design features of the front face,\\nwhere the pure apportionment test or pure causation test\\nwould limit the profits to the profits from the design\\nparts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,\\nthat\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting a\\nlittle more with article of manufacture than we do with\\na pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy\\nfor that.\\nBut the reason we think it\\'s consistent with\\nCongress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress\\nwas trying to do was provide a rule that gives\\ndesign-patent holders total profit from the article of\\nmanufacture.\\n\\n13\\nThat\\'s a little bit overinclusive, because\\nif you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue\\nin the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from the\\ndesign, and there will be a little extra you\\'re getting\\nperhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress\\nwas entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say\\nthat it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say\\nthat design causes value in a single article product\\nlike a rug.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at this\\nrecord, and they were claiming the profits on the whole\\nphone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, they\\nwere saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --\\nthis was their argument to the jury and it sold the\\nFederal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,\\nthat, you know, all smartphones basically function the\\nsame. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.\\nThis is what they were arguing, and they put on an\\nexpert that gave total profits. If the jury credited\\nthem, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a\\nproperly instructed jury, could you overturn that\\nfinding?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back to\\nthe proper instruction. The jury was not properly\\ninstructed here.\\n\\n14\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,\\nMiss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. If\\nthe article of manufacture was the entire ornamental\\nappearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on\\nthe entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assert\\nit here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone\\ndoes not look substantially similar to the entire\\noutside of a Samsung phone. The reason why design\\npatencies carve the product up into multiple partial\\ndesign claims is so they can make a narrow infringement\\nargument and find a little sliver of the phone on which\\ninfringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate to\\ngive total profit when they do that.\\nSo, Your Honor, if there had been a design\\npatent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple\\ncould have tried to get total profit on the entire case.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\\n\"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properly\\ninstructed jury on the evidence presented in this case\\ncould not have found for Apple. Is that what --\\nMS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\nThat is very much our position.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the jury\\ninstruction, what was the legal error?\\n\\n15\\nMS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in the\\njury instruction --\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides a\\nproperly instructed jury, could they have found in favor\\nof Apple on the evidence presented?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,\\nbecause --\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides the\\njury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a proper\\ninstruction was given -- what would have been the legal\\nerror?\\nMS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- no\\nreasonable jury could have found on this record that the\\nentire product was the article of manufacture to which\\nthe design has been applied. Two reasons.\\nOne, design patents cover ornamental\\nappearance. They cannot, by definition, cover the\\ninnards of the phone. So the functional innards of the\\nphone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design\\npatent.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claim\\nthe design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover the\\ninnards, but you just admitted that a jury could find\\nits -- could find that the consumers and others would\\n1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looksonly.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talkingabout design patents, not trademark or copyright.There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here onthe -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree withyou, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answeryour question as precisely as I can. Just because youcan show that most of the profit comes from the Beetleexterior does not mean the car is the article ofmanufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test.First, determine what is the article ofmanufacture.Then second step, determine the quantum ofdamages, quantum of profits in this case, from thatarticle.Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almostall its profits from the exterior case, people wereindifferent to whether they could read their e-mail,navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If youcould prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'thappen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvetteor the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion ofthe total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at thetrial, propose basing damages on profits from an articleless than the whole phone?MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. Andwe were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the juryinstruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began,we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket 1322. We saidvery clearly article of manufacture is less than thetotal phone and profit should be limited to the profitfrom the article. We said again in the juryinstructions -- and here I would refer you respectfullyto joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that onpetition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to thecourt and we said please listen to us about article ofmanufacture, if you only get the total profit on thearticle. The district court said, no, I already said noapportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said noapportionment, she shut us out of both theories. Thedistrict court shut us out of article of manufacture asthe basis for total profit, and it shut us out ofcausation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here.So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, ourcharge conference. And then again in our 50A and the1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we againsaid article is separate from apportionment, and thearticle here is less than the phone. At 197 we saidat -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is lessthan the phone. And in the 50B at the close of thefirst trial, we again said article is less than thephone.Second trial happens on certain phones.Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court saysagain, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment fordesign patents. You cannot talk to me about article ofmanufacture. We tried over and over and over again toget the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and wewere rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor?Because there was evidence in the case from which areasonable, properly instructed jury could have foundthat the components were the front face, the front face,and the display screen. And the evidence came out ofApple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled torely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again andagain said what are you claiming. And when thewitnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'tsay the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'reclaiming a very specific front face, and by the way,ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignoreeverything that\\'s outside the dotted lines.And if I could just remind you that we\\'vereprinted the patents for you to see, and they may looklike an iPhone on page 7, which is the D\\'677. They maylook like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was inBlueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone.The claim is for the small portion of the externalappearance of the phone that is inside the solid line.Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. Itdisclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines.And Your Honor, the question for the jurywas not did people think that the look and feel of aniPhone was great. The question for the jury was did thevery small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makeslook substantially similar to the very small portion ofthe patent claim?Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis inthis record for a conclusion that the entire product,profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profitfrom those articles. What Apple should have done isdone either of the two things we discussed earlier,accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goodssold on the components, or it should have done consumersurvey evidence like our expert did.1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General hasproposed a test with four factors to determine thearticle question. Do you agree with those? Are thereothers you would add?MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answerbriefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time.We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test.We propose a briefer test that we think is moreadministrable. We propose that you look to two factors:The design in the patent and the accused product. Wethink our test is more administrable, and it can oftenbe done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do inMarkman, who will then instruct the jury and give themguidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further onrebuttal. Thank you very much.I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time,Mr. Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Fletcher.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHERFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTYMR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:This case presents two related questionsabout the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for\\n\\n21\\ndesign-patent infringement under Section 289. If I\\nunderstood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentation\\ncorrectly, the parties are now in agreement about both\\nof those legal questions.\\nJust to summarize briefly, first, the court\\nof appeals correctly held that Section 289\\'s provision\\nfor an award of total profits means that the\\npatent-holder can recover all of the profits from the\\nsale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not\\njust the portion of the profits that the patent-holder\\ncan prove was caused by or attributable to the design as\\nopposed to other features of the article.\\nBut second, we read the court of appeals\\'\\nopinion to have held that the relevant article of\\nmanufacture for which profits are owed is always the\\nentire product that the infringer sells to customers.\\nAnd we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand all\\nparties to agree with that now.\\nInstead, the relevant article of manufacture\\nto which a patented design may be applied will sometimes\\nbe a part or a component of a larger product sold in\\ncommerce. And when that is the case, all parties now\\nagree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the\\nprofits from that infringing article and not to all --\\n1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when thecomponent -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t soldapart from the entire product, how should the -- thejudge charge the jury on determining the profitattributable to the infringing article?MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d betwo factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed.The first one would be what is the relevant article, andthere may be a dispute on that as there is in this case.The second question, once the fact-finderidentifies the relevant article, is the question thatyou asked, which is how much of the total profits fromthe device are attributable to the infringing article?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step,and how do you figure it out?JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he completehis answer to my question?MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on thesecond step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in alot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in thiscase. This case sort of stopped at the first step. Butwe think that courts could sensibly look to the way thatcourts have handled other analogous questions, and Ipoint to two areas of law where that\\'s happened.The first is utility patent damages under1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of theinfringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often apatent would apply to part of a larger product sold incommerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitledto the profits that are attributable to the infringingpart, but not the whole machine.JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- JusticeGinsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her,adequately summarized, the test that you propose atpageof your brief relevant considerations include?MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test wepropose at pagegoes to the first of the two questionsthat I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article ofmanufacture to which the design has been applied? Oncethe fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the testthat we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to beJustice Sotomayor\\'s question.I understood Justice Ginsburg to be askingonce the fact-finder decides that the relevant articleis, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder onthe car, how do they separate out the part of theprofits that are attributable to that component from thewhole.And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefedit in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems thatcourts have confronted in other areas of law. One wasutility patent damages, as I described. Another one isdiscussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in theSheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a casewhere the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses becalled on in order to show part one or part two or both?MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very oftenboth.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would thoseexpert witnesses -- who would they be? What would theysay?MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will dependon -- on the circumstances of the case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case.MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someonefamiliar with the industry, someone who had worked inthe industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphonecompany, or someone who is familiar with the market forsmartphones and who could speak to on the first questionhow smartphones are put together, how they aremanufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extentto which the components of a smartphone are separable.And then on the second question, the one1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could bespeaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised inyour question in the Sullivan, which is things likeconsumer surveys, to what extent do the variouscomponents of a smartphone drive consumer demand andcontribute to the value of the phone.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of thethings that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. Idon\\'t understand how that helps on this question. Itwould seem to me the higher the cost, the less itcontributed to profits.MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. ChiefJustice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits fromthe bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each ofthese components, and then what share of the revenue isattributable to each of these components. And then yousay this component ispercent of the cost and20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-upcalculation and try to do it that way.Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimesthat won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation andsaid the total profits on this product are $10 million,1 and we think that the component at issue here, based onexpert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or25 percent.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said basedon expert testimony. What would -- what would they betalking about?MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldoncase that\\'s cited on pageof our brief from thisCourt that was a Copyright Act case but discussed theseproblems sort of generally discussed how you apportionthe portion -- the profits from a movie that areattributable to the script as opposed to the actors orthe directors or other things. And they had experts whowere familiar with the industry and who said the scriptis important but, really, a lot of the value andparticularly for a movie like this comes from otherthings.And there were various expert testimoniesthat gave varying percentages, and the Court ended upsaying that the court below had awardedpercent ofthe total profits from the movie, and this Courtaffirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonableapproximation.We\\'re not -- never going to be able to getto certainty, but on these sorts of profits questionsand these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable\\n\\n27\\napproximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly better\\nthan awarding all or nothing. And courts have been able\\nto come to those reasonable approximations by using\\nexpert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'ve\\ndiscussed.\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could you\\nspeak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I\\nunderstand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, that\\ndistinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'s\\njust -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body of\\nthe car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a real\\nquestion as to whether it is being -- the design is\\nbeing applied to the car itself.\\nSo how would you go about thinking about\\nthat question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and\\nunder what instructions?\\nMR. FLETCHER: So we think the basic\\nquestion for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article of\\nmanufacture to which the design has been applied. We\\nthink the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'s\\nobservation in Gorham. It\\'s 1871, first design patent\\ncase that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thing\\nthat gives the distinctive appearance to an article of\\nmanufacture.\\n1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bugexample is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be veryeasy. If the patented design is for a refrigeratorlatch, no one is going to think that the latch gives thedistinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator.JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk aboutthe hard cases.MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases,like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s eitherthe body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court fourfactors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if thejury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on thosefactors. And so we say you should compare the scope ofthe patented design as shown in the drawings in thepatent, how prominently that design features in theaccused article, whether there are other conceptuallydistinct innovations or components in the article thatare not part of or associated with the patented design,and finally the physical relationship between thepatented design and the rest of the article.JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, howwould you decide the Beetle case, or what experts wouldyou want to hear?MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- asto the article, what\\'s the article --1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given youthat second option.MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s afactual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear fromexperts who can speak to the question of how is theBeetle put together, and what other parts of the -- theBeetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetleput together? It\\'s put together like every other car.I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whetherthe shape of the body is distinctive or not.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also wantto know, to put it in terms of all four factors, thatthe scope of the claim design covers the whole article,but not the interior of the car. There are designfeatures in the interior that the driver sees thataren\\'t the body of the article.As to the second factor, how prominent isthe design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts infavor of finding that the design does cover the wholearticle.Then the third one is conceptually distinctinnovations, and I think that one cuts the other way.There are going to be lots of other features of the caror innovations in the car -- the engine, the steeringsystem, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you\\n\\n30\\nmight want to hear adverse testimony.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the first\\npart of the test.\\nMR. FLETCHER: Correct.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article of\\nmanufacture.\\nSo now take the second part of the test and\\napply it to the Bug.\\nMR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'ve\\ndecided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug\\nis just the body of the Bug.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\\nMR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question is\\nthe best way to determine that, at least that I can\\nthink of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed\\nto, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their\\npurchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and\\nto what extent are they instead valuing other things\\nlike --\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that that\\nquestion is not relevant to the first question. In\\nother words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs\\nbuy them because of the look of the car.\\nMR. FLETCHER: Yes.\\n\\n31JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'sonly relevant at questionrather than at question 1,which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or thewhole car that the design is being applied to?MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s thestatute -- the way the statute reads. It says you getprofits from the article of manufacture. And so,logically, I think the way to approach it would beidentify the article and then let the patent-holder makethe argument that even though the article may be just apart of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s justthe case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sellsit. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder,in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'sselling the whole product, still recover a verysubstantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way.JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is nothelpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought thatnobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they likethe way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think,$1800 when it was first sold in the United States? Whatif it cost $18,000? What if it gotmiles per gallon?What if it broke down every 50 miles?\\n32So if that is a real question, if it is areal question whether the article of manufacture thereis the design or the entire car, gives me pause aboutthe test for determining what is the article ofmanufacture.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that thosethings can be taken into account at the second step ofthe test, if you decide that the relevant design -- therelevant article of manufacture is the body of the car,but for all of the reasons you just pointed out.JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- youwere saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficultquestion. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors todetermine what is the article of manufacture there.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think ifyou\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test forarticle of manufacture also lets some of thoseconsiderations play into that test, because it gets towhether there are other conceptually distinct invasions,or other components of the product unrelated to thedesign.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\\n33MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:Before I address the Court\\'s many questionsinitiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jurybe instructed under what we and the government believeto be the relevant question -- that is, the factual testof whether the relevant article of manufacture is thearticle as sold or a distinct component of it -- and Ithink it\\'s very clear to address the questions thatJustice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, andMs. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened inthis case.There is no -- whatever you determine theright instruction should be, there is no basis tooverturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case.There were two trials below. In neithertrial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, orwitness testimony, ever identify for the jury anyarticle of manufacture other than the phones themselves.In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner,calculated total profits under 289 only on the phonesthemselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable jurorin these trials could possibly have awarded totalprofits on anything other than the phones, unless thisCourt holds --\\n34JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because thedistrict judge limited them?MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happenedwas, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s apretrial statement that the parties have to file saying,these are -- the phones are the -- the phones wereinfringed. The phones are the things that wereinfringed for purposes of sale, and here is what ourevidence is on total profits from the phone.JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on thispoint. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough questiontrying to figure out what the standard is. Now, whycan\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to yourarguments and theirs, and work it out?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not adifficult -- the record in this case is not difficult.JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'sdifficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'sdifficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side.So if I go through and come to theconclusion, at least, that each side has a goodargument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focuson the question that is of great importance across\\n35industries and leave the application of that and whetherit was properly raised to the lower courts?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this weredifficult, it would be entirely appropriate for thisCourt simply to announce what the law is, which I thinkthere is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'renot suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'tnecessary for the Court to do it.This is a case very much like global tech,when you found that the lower court had applied thewrong standard for intentional infringement, and thenfound that the record -- even -- but under the correcthigher standard, the record admitted no otherconclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that theynever identified to the jury, in either case, anyarticle of manufacture other than the phone. And all oftheir evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based onthe total profits to the phone.JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'llread it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you.JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question onthe general issue, which I think is tough. And thegeneral question that I have is I have been looking fora standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all\\n36quite close; the parties actually in the government arefairly close on this -- but is in a brief for theInternet Association, the software industry. And youknow that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and someothers.MR. WAXMAN: I do.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did isthey went back into history. They have a lot ofdifferent cases which they base the standard on, andthey come to the conclusion, which is a little vague,but that the design where it\\'s been applied to onlypart -- it\\'s on page-- of a multicomponent productand does not drive demand for the entire product, thearticle of manufacture is rightly considered to be onlythe component to which the design applies. And onlyprofit attributable to that component may be awarded.Now, really, to understand it, you have tohave examples -- but antitrust cases are hard tounderstand -- and our rule of reason and people do useexamples. And so that kind of standard, with perhapsexamples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper,you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on thehood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit fromthe car.MR. WAXMAN: Justice --\\n37JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not?MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand yourquestion, and I just want to bookmark the fact that Ihave not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'squestion.JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead andanswer her question. At some point you can come back toit.MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer JusticeGinsburg first and then Justice Breyer.Justice Ginsburg, the only thing thatSamsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened inthe Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report,Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed topresent evidence about that -- about the value of designto the total product as a whole. That wasapportionment, Judge Koh said.He wanted -- he calculated total profitsbased on the phone. And his report then said, well, butI believe that onlypercent of the value of the phoneis due to the design or the design of the iconic frontface of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him todo because that was apportionment.The question -- the only issue with respectto article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in\\n38either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as amatter of law in a multicomponent product, the articleof manufacture must be the portion.They never said that to the jury. They didpropose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed thejury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It alsodirected the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'tapprove it. Now, it just so happens that they preservedno relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'respending an awful lot of time on an issue about what wasraised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raisedbelow, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time toturn to Justice Breyer\\'s question.MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to dothat.Justice Breyer, the -- there is no questionthat in an appropriate case the jury can decide whetherthe article of manufacture to which the design isapplied and to which it provides a distinctive andpleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'sactually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers,or it could be a component of it.In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'sreally not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,\\n39there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question offact for the jury.We believe that the -- the four factors thatthe Solicitor General articulated would be appropriatefactors to consider.I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is thequestion of fact?MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to whichthe law applies? What -- what is the question of fact?MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In acase in which the jury heard evidence as to competingarticles of manufacture, as to what total profits shouldbe applied to, the jury would be told, if you findinfringement, total profits are awarded on the articleof manufacture to which the patented design was appliedfor the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiaror distinctive appearance.You may determine that the article ofmanufacture is the entire product or a distinctcomponent of that product. In making thatdetermination, you may consider, and this would dependon the evidence in the case, among other factors I wouldinclude the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other\\n40things. For example, most importantly the identity ofwhat it is that is typically consumed by purchasers.Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumersto purchase the infringing product thinking it to be thepatentee\\'s product.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m notgrasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to methat the design is applied to the exterior case of thephone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips andwires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And,you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent onsomething that the consumer can\\'t see. And yetCongress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entireprice of the phone.MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded onthe article of manufacture to which the design isapplied.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, thecase is part of it.MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I\\n41think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s importantto understand that design is not a component and thepatented design is not the article of manufacture. Thepatented design is something that\\'s applied to anarticle of manufacture.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well,these -- these little, the chips and all are articles ofmanufacture, right? How is the design of the caseapplied to those chips?MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, ifyou look at, for example, in the early days, when thepatent -- when the design -- when design patents werefirst permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 ofthem were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines andthings like that. Congress -- when Congress said thatyou are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobsoncases, that as an alternative remedy, if there isinfringement of a design -- which, by the way, does nothappen innocently.When there is infringement of a design, thepatentee may choose an alternative remedy which isessentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoesof the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge theprofits from the article to which the design was1 applied.\\n42\\nThere\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plenty\\nof working components, but a design is not a component.\\nA design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to\\ndecide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either\\na cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape\\nof the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude\\nthat because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW\\nBeetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the\\nBeetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer\\ncopied it.\\nThe -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documents\\nin this case, for example, that are recounted in our\\nbrief, Samsung realized that it faced what this\\nexecutive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of\\ndesign was reflected, the documents show, in the\\ntelephone company saying, you have to create something\\nlike the iPhone, and a directive came out to create\\nsomething like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing\\nsales. And in three months --\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we go\\nback to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far your\\ntest has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'s\\ngoing towards. Okay.\\nThey suggest two things. Article of\\n\\n43manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have afour-part test. Do you agree that that four-part testwith respect to identifying just the article ofmanufacture?MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveatonly. What -- the factors that the jury will be toldwill depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go tothe -- to the record.MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'msticking with the test.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s thetest.MR. WAXMAN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, becauseit makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybodyelse, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards,are the article of manufacture.Now, the government would say, go to thesecond test, which takes in some of the things that youwere talking about, to figure out how much of theprofits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable tothe shape of the car.Now, as Justice Alito said, some peopledon\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want\\n44just a small car. They want the car that has a certaintrunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons.Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s90 percent of the profits. It may be that the bodyaccounts for onlypercent of the cost of the car, but90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shapeof the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis?That\\'s what I understand the government\\'sanalysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be toldto do, to decide how much value the design is to theproduct being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in anutshell.MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a testthat the government has articulated here at oralargument. It has not been briefed by anybody.The issue of how you calculate total profitson something less than the whole article as sold waswrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit inthe second Piano case, where in the second Piano case,the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test,how do you determine what the article of manufacture is,hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The realdifficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of theprofits from that article of manufacture.The -- the few courts that have addressedthis that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I\\n\\n45\\nthink probably makes the most sense and is the least\\ndifficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were\\nthe costs of producing that article, that particular\\nsubcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit margin\\non the product as a whole applied to that little\\ncomponent?\\nNow, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I\\nthink that\\'s what courts have generally done. And what\\nit underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be\\nappropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it\\nunderscores is the very --\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get off\\ntrack.\\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay.\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that part\\nof the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'re\\nsaying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The government\\nis saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is\\nthat right?\\nMR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct\\nthat under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the\\ntotal profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture\\nto which the design has been applied. That is\\nrelatively straightforward when, in a contested case,\\n\\n46the jury concludes that the article of manufacture isthe product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated whenthe jury concludes that the relevant article ofmanufacture, as was the case in the piano cases wherecustomers could choose an array of cases in which to putthe piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure outtotal profits from the manufacture and sale of the case.But the decided cases that I have seen havelooked at the question what was the manufacture -- whatwere the direct costs associated with producing therelevant piano cases and what was the profit margin onthe piano as applied to that.And may I just add one other point which Ithink is still on track. The problem with that is thatit runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congresswas concerned about in 1887 when it passed the DesignPatent Act, because the concern was that counterfeitersand copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the onlycompensation was something that could be viewed as thecost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going toget apercent margin on $2.50 for what it cost toproduce this little component, there would be nodeterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency.Yes, Justice Kagan.JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and Ithink that the VW example is a good example for this\\n\\n47\\nreason -- where the thing that makes the product\\ndistinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s not\\nbeen a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or\\nsome graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said\\nI just have this great idea for an appearance. But\\nthat\\'s the principal reason why the product has been\\nsuccessful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to\\ndo all the other things that cars do, but the principal\\nreason why the car has been successful has to do with\\nthis particular appearance, the design.\\nAs I understood the government, that does\\nnot come into the first inquiry. That does not come\\ninto the question of what is the article. It only comes\\ninto the second inquiry, which is how much of the\\nprofits are attributable to that article.\\nDo you agree with that?\\nMR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- I\\ndon\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test as\\nyou have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. I\\nthink that the government\\'s -- if you look at the\\ngovernment\\'s factors, you know, one factor is the\\nrelative prominence of the design within the product as\\na whole. And the government says that whether the\\ndesign -- in other words, whether the design is a\\n\\n48significant attribute of the entire product affectingthe appearance of the product as a whole would suggestthat the article should be the product.Another factor in the government\\'s test isthe physical relationship between the patented designand the rest of the product. In other words, as thegovernment\\'s brief says, can the user or the sellerphysically separate it, or is it manufacturedseparately.Another factor is whether the design isconceptually different from the product as a whole, as,for example, a design on a book binding is differentfrom the intellectual property reflected in thecopyright material in the book. Those -- we agree withall those factors as relevant, but I do think directly,you know, speaking to the question that you raised, thefirst factor that I mentioned, the relative prominenceof the design within the product of the whole is inessence asking -- and it is a relevant question indetermining the article of manufacture -- whether thepatented design is likely to cause the consumers topurchase the infringing product thinking it to be thepatentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- Ican\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetleexample, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was\\n49similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep ora Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebodywho looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied theiconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well saythat, and a jury would take that into account.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is theapproach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as\"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word?MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. Andif there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- whatword would you use to describe your approach?MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the articleof manufacture, to which the design is applied forpurposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive andpleasing appearance. Apportionment is what theirexpert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying thetotal profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions ofdollars, but I find that only one percent of consumersbuy phones because of the front face of the phone eitheroff or on.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identifiedthe relevant article, then it seems to me necessarilywhat you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'tsee how we can get away from that word.\\n50MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, JusticeKennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" onceyou -- if you -- if the jury answers the question atstepand says no, no, no, the article of manufactureis the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do wedetermine total profits from the sale of that thing?You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment thatlooks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder andwhat is the -- you know, what is the profit margin forthe car or the refrigerator or something like that.That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it ifyou found it.So, you know, in this case it\\'s a littledifficult to figure out what the alternative article ofmanufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court evenbefore the trial judge, they never even suggested whatthe article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent,the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is nothelpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder isknows what the determination must -- what determinationmust be made. The factors are helpful in making thedetermination.Now what you just said about the article ofmanufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is\\n51applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said?MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury isquoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in 1872decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufactureis the thing to which the design is applied for purposesof sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing,attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to findout -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physicalsense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'swhat the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s appliedto the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it ina different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- whereis the design applied? Is it applied to the inside?No. It\\'s applied to the outside.MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, bydefinition, applies to the outside. It has to apply tosomething that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say whatit\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms ofthe physical world, so what is -- what are you talkingabout?MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked todecide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that\\n52this was a patentable design and you find under Gorhamthat it was infringed, what is the thing to which thatdesign was applied to give it a pleasing appearance.Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or thesoftware. It is applied to the phone. Now, they couldif they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to thejury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to theoutside of the phone.MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to theoutside of an article. It has to be applied to theoutside of an article.I see my time is expired. Thank you verymuch.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Miss Sullivan. Four minutes.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say thatall apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'tapportion the value of the design in relation to thearticle. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did\\n53not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article fromthe other articles that make up the product. So we cansegregate article from other articles within theproduct. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to dothat because it allows total profit only from thatarticle of manufacture to which the design has applied.Now, the test that we ask the Court toannounce on remand. As has been discussed, it has twoparts.The first is -- the antecedent question isidentify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimesthat will be very easy if you do it from two mainfactors. What does the patent scope claim, a frontface, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing?And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for theinstruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, weactually asked the jury to be told that where thearticle of manufacture is a case or external housing,that\\'s the article of manufacture.The second question is quantum of profits.And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in sayingthat a lot of the expert determinations about how muchdid the Beetle exterior drive demand will come intoplay, as the government said and we agree, only at thesecond question: What is the quantum of profits fromthe right article of manufacture?\\n\\n54\\nBut, Justice Alito, you asked how similar\\nare we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,\\nyou asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency\\namong juries.\\nWe think the answer to the first question\\ncan be made more consistent and uniform if we focus\\nmainly on two factors: What does the design in the\\npatent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the\\nfront face? And second, what is the product to which it\\nhas been applied? That will help judges to guide\\njuries.\\nWe think we should have had instruction\\n42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary\\njudgment that the article of manufacture is the front\\nface, and that could be instructed to the jury.\\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, is\\nthat Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though\\nthey only want to apply it to the front.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem in\\nthe case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed to\\nthe brief I did point to -- that history is matters\\nhere, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponent\\nproduct.\\n\\n55MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell thejury that there is that distinction, I think you eitherdisregard what Congress meant in its statute or youcreate the kind of absurd results that your brief isfull of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked atpage 23, and it says that seems to do it.MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with pageofthe tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why youmust remand in this case.This case was tried under the improper ruleof law. We tried at every juncture to get the correctrule of law adopted. And the district court said, Iforbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re notasking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article ofmanufacture. And we were shut down over and over againon that.So you must remand and tell the nation\\'seconomy that no one can claim a partial design patent ona portion of a front face of an electronic device andcome in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juriesshould be instructed that the article of manufactureeither is the Beetle exterior or there might be, JusticeBreyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary\\n\\n56\\narticles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon\\nmight be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,\\nbut nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the\\nspoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the\\nspoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,\\nthat\\'s all right.\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of\\nshowing what is the relevant article? I assume in a\\ncase like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.\\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave\\nyou with the most important disagreement we have with\\nthe government and with Apple, the burden is on the\\nplaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what\\nthe article of manufacture is.\\nWhy is that? The burden is on the plaintiff\\nto show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in\\nwhat the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'s\\nburden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal\\nCircuit shows. With respect, we request that you\\nremand -- vacate and remand.\\nThank you very much, Your Honor.\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\nThe case is submitted.\\n('"

       "'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\\'ll hear argumentfirst this morning in Case No. 15-777, SamsungElectronics v. Apple, Incorporated.Ms. Sullivan.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:A smartphone is smart because it containshundreds of thousands of the technologies that make itwork. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 ofthe Patent Act entitles the holder of a single designpatent on a portion of the appearance of the phone tototal profit on the entire phone.That result makes no sense. A single designpatent on the portion of the appearance of a phoneshould not entitle the design-patent holder to all theprofit on the entire phone.Section 289 does not require that result,and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing,Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 doesnot require that result. We respectfully ask that theCourt hold that when a design patent claims a design1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a componentof a product, or, to use the language of Section 289,when a design patent is applied to an article ofmanufacture within a multi-article product, we requestthat you hold that Section 289 entitles thepatent-holder to total profit on the article ofmanufacture to which the design patent is applied, andnot the profits on the total product.JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how toinstruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not thegovernment, both parties kind of leave it up and say,oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simplywouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test.My preference, if -- if I were just makinganother sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies tosee how the -- the extent to which the design affectedthe consumer, and then the jury would have something todo that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlonginto the statute.You can\\'t really have apportionment, so itseems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is tohave a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder examplethat\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which isa little more difficult -- and just follow the -- andjust follow the words of the statute. But it seems tome neither side gives us an instruction to work with.5MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s onething to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --if I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do underyour brief.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not proposea test that simply leaves it to the jury withoutguidance. The instruction we proposed and that wasrejected by the district court appears in the blue briefat page 21, and what we would have told the jury is thatthe article of manufacture to which a design has beenapplied is the part or portion of the product as soldthat incorporates or embodies the subject matter of thepatent.So, Justice Kennedy, our test is verysimple.JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I justdon\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the juryroom; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what werespectfully suggest is that there are two parts to thetest for what constitutes an article of manufacture.And to be clear, I\\'m now stressing ourarticle-of-manufacture argument, not the causationargument we gave as an alternative.6As the case comes to the Court, all we askis that you rule in favor of us on article ofmanufacture.And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells uswhat to look at --JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly makesure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --you\\'re saying we should only look to what an article ofmanufacture is and not your other argument that thereshould be apportionment as to any particular article ofmanufacture.MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.We\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve thecase, that a jury should be instructed that total profitmust be profit derived from the article of manufactureto which the design has been applied.And, Your Honor, the statute does supportour test because the statute asks us to look at thearticle of manufacture to which the design has beenapplied.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that inthis -- in this case?MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case itis -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-corneredfront face of a phone.In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular,round-cornered front face of the phone with certainaspect ratio and corner radii.In the D\\'305, it is the display screen onwhich the graphical user interface appears.So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question,the jury should have been instructed either with ourinstruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to thejury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article ofmanufacture here, but it may be less than the entirephone. The article of manufacture may be a part orportion of the phone, and you should look at two things,Your Honor.You should look at the patent, and, JusticeKennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look atthe -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought tolook at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patentis going to be the best guide to what the design isapplied to in many, many cases, as in this case.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seemto be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter oflaw, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matterof law.1 I believe that your basic argument, everyoneis in agreement, that the test is an article ofmanufacture for purposes of sale.But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, howdo we announce the right test for that? Because thephone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumeras being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. Thatmight be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know.Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how tofigure out the component part. I don\\'t know where inthe record you would have enough to survive yourargument.MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me backup and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence.The -- the test -- and I want to agree withYour Honor. To be clear, we say that what the FederalCircuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrongas a matter of law to hold that the entire product isnecessarily the article of manufacture from which youmeasure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law,but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has tohold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law.It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question ofeither fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrelquestion of law and fact.1 And why does it involve both? Because weknow that district courts look at patents. You assignthem that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. Andwhen they look at a patent for a claim construction,we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar.The district court can look at the patentand say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. Thisisn\\'t one of Apple\\'sother patents on other parts ofthe phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of theentire case. This is the front face patent.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how wouldyou determine the profit attributable to the relevantarticle of manufacture?MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor.First, through ordinary accounting thatwould look to the cost of goods sold in relation torevenues for the relevant component.You could look, if -- if a company buys thecomponent from an original equipment manufacturer, youwould look to their profit margins and apply that.If, as sometimes happens within a company,one division makes the glass front face and anotherdivision makes the innards of the phone, you would findout the transfer pricing between the divisions.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent onthe inner parts and a hundred million was spent on theface, then it\\'s a 10:1 ratio.MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, YourHonor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have experttestimony on all of that.MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would.And you would -- but that\\'s just one way.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you hada case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some ofthe briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetledesign was done in three days, and it was a stroke ofgenius and it identified the car. Then it seems to methat that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give threedays\\' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to developthe motor.MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s whatwe would do with the Beetle.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- itseems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing.MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. Toanswer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove thetotal profit from the relevant article of manufactureshere, the front face, or the display screen. One couldhave been accounting. One could have been consumerdemand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested.Apple could have said well, people really like the frontface disproportionately to all the other parts of thephone, so they could have used consumer survey evidenceto prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence orindirect evidence through consumer survey. But, YourHonor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the totalprofit from the article of manufacture may sometimes bea substantial part of the total profit on the product.Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool,shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette.It may be that the article of manufacture to which thedesign patent is applied is just the exterior body ofthe car, but it may be that nobody really wants to paymuch for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle.They want to pay for the cool way it looks.If that\\'s so, it should be open to thepatent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits comefrom the exterior of the car.JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference inpractical terms between that and your causation argumentor apportionment?12MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?MS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concedeunder article of manufacture that the holder of thepatent gets profit from the article, even if the profitdoes not come entirely from the design.Let me give you an example with a phone\\'sfront face. Consumers may value the front face becauseit\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,because it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give thepatent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test allthe profits for the front face, even if it includesprofit from those non-design features of the front face,where the pure apportionment test or pure causation testwould limit the profits to the profits from the designparts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,that\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting alittle more with article of manufacture than we do witha pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happyfor that.But the reason we think it\\'s consistent withCongress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congresswas trying to do was provide a rule that givesdesign-patent holders total profit from the article ofmanufacture.13That\\'s a little bit overinclusive, becauseif you get total profit on the rugs that were at issuein the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from thedesign, and there will be a little extra you\\'re gettingperhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congresswas entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to saythat it is appropriate as a matter of causation to saythat design causes value in a single article productlike a rug.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at thisrecord, and they were claiming the profits on the wholephone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, theywere saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --this was their argument to the jury and it sold theFederal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,that, you know, all smartphones basically function thesame. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.This is what they were arguing, and they put on anexpert that gave total profits. If the jury creditedthem, could you -- and you were properly -- it was aproperly instructed jury, could you overturn thatfinding?MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back tothe proper instruction. The jury was not properlyinstructed here.14JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,Miss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --MS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. Ifthe article of manufacture was the entire ornamentalappearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent onthe entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assertit here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phonedoes not look substantially similar to the entireoutside of a Samsung phone. The reason why designpatencies carve the product up into multiple partialdesign claims is so they can make a narrow infringementargument and find a little sliver of the phone on whichinfringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate togive total profit when they do that.So, Your Honor, if there had been a designpatent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Applecould have tried to get total profit on the entire case.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properlyinstructed jury on the evidence presented in this casecould not have found for Apple. Is that what --MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.That is very much our position.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the juryinstruction, what was the legal error?15MS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in thejury instruction --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides aproperly instructed jury, could they have found in favorof Apple on the evidence presented?MS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,because --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides thejury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a properinstruction was given -- what would have been the legalerror?MS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- noreasonable jury could have found on this record that theentire product was the article of manufacture to whichthe design has been applied. Two reasons.One, design patents cover ornamentalappearance. They cannot, by definition, cover theinnards of the phone. So the functional innards of thephone cannot be part of what is claimed by the designpatent.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claimthe design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover theinnards, but you just admitted that a jury could findits -- could find that the consumers and others would1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looksonly.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talkingabout design patents, not trademark or copyright.There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here onthe -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree withyou, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answeryour question as precisely as I can. Just because youcan show that most of the profit comes from the Beetleexterior does not mean the car is the article ofmanufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test.First, determine what is the article ofmanufacture.Then second step, determine the quantum ofdamages, quantum of profits in this case, from thatarticle.Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almostall its profits from the exterior case, people wereindifferent to whether they could read their e-mail,navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If youcould prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'thappen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvetteor the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion ofthe total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at thetrial, propose basing damages on profits from an articleless than the whole phone?MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. Andwe were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the juryinstruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began,we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket 1322. We saidvery clearly article of manufacture is less than thetotal phone and profit should be limited to the profitfrom the article. We said again in the juryinstructions -- and here I would refer you respectfullyto joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that onpetition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to thecourt and we said please listen to us about article ofmanufacture, if you only get the total profit on thearticle. The district court said, no, I already said noapportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said noapportionment, she shut us out of both theories. Thedistrict court shut us out of article of manufacture asthe basis for total profit, and it shut us out ofcausation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here.So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, ourcharge conference. And then again in our 50A and the1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we againsaid article is separate from apportionment, and thearticle here is less than the phone. At 197 we saidat -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is lessthan the phone. And in the 50B at the close of thefirst trial, we again said article is less than thephone.Second trial happens on certain phones.Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court saysagain, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment fordesign patents. You cannot talk to me about article ofmanufacture. We tried over and over and over again toget the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and wewere rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor?Because there was evidence in the case from which areasonable, properly instructed jury could have foundthat the components were the front face, the front face,and the display screen. And the evidence came out ofApple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled torely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again andagain said what are you claiming. And when thewitnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'tsay the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'reclaiming a very specific front face, and by the way,ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignoreeverything that\\'s outside the dotted lines.And if I could just remind you that we\\'vereprinted the patents for you to see, and they may looklike an iPhone on page 7, which is the D\\'677. They maylook like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was inBlueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone.The claim is for the small portion of the externalappearance of the phone that is inside the solid line.Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. Itdisclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines.And Your Honor, the question for the jurywas not did people think that the look and feel of aniPhone was great. The question for the jury was did thevery small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makeslook substantially similar to the very small portion ofthe patent claim?Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis inthis record for a conclusion that the entire product,profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profitfrom those articles. What Apple should have done isdone either of the two things we discussed earlier,accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goodssold on the components, or it should have done consumersurvey evidence like our expert did.1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General hasproposed a test with four factors to determine thearticle question. Do you agree with those? Are thereothers you would add?MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answerbriefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time.We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test.We propose a briefer test that we think is moreadministrable. We propose that you look to two factors:The design in the patent and the accused product. Wethink our test is more administrable, and it can oftenbe done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do inMarkman, who will then instruct the jury and give themguidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further onrebuttal. Thank you very much.I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time,Mr. Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Fletcher.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHERFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTYMR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:This case presents two related questionsabout the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for21design-patent infringement under Section 289. If Iunderstood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentationcorrectly, the parties are now in agreement about bothof those legal questions.Just to summarize briefly, first, the courtof appeals correctly held that Section 289\\'s provisionfor an award of total profits means that thepatent-holder can recover all of the profits from thesale of the infringing articles and manufacture and notjust the portion of the profits that the patent-holdercan prove was caused by or attributable to the design asopposed to other features of the article.But second, we read the court of appeals\\'opinion to have held that the relevant article ofmanufacture for which profits are owed is always theentire product that the infringer sells to customers.And we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand allparties to agree with that now.Instead, the relevant article of manufactureto which a patented design may be applied will sometimesbe a part or a component of a larger product sold incommerce. And when that is the case, all parties nowagree that the patent-holder is entitled only to theprofits from that infringing article and not to all --1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when thecomponent -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t soldapart from the entire product, how should the -- thejudge charge the jury on determining the profitattributable to the infringing article?MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d betwo factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed.The first one would be what is the relevant article, andthere may be a dispute on that as there is in this case.The second question, once the fact-finderidentifies the relevant article, is the question thatyou asked, which is how much of the total profits fromthe device are attributable to the infringing article?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step,and how do you figure it out?JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he completehis answer to my question?MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on thesecond step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in alot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in thiscase. This case sort of stopped at the first step. Butwe think that courts could sensibly look to the way thatcourts have handled other analogous questions, and Ipoint to two areas of law where that\\'s happened.The first is utility patent damages under1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of theinfringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often apatent would apply to part of a larger product sold incommerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitledto the profits that are attributable to the infringingpart, but not the whole machine.JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- JusticeGinsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her,adequately summarized, the test that you propose atpageof your brief relevant considerations include?MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test wepropose at pagegoes to the first of the two questionsthat I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article ofmanufacture to which the design has been applied? Oncethe fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the testthat we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to beJustice Sotomayor\\'s question.I understood Justice Ginsburg to be askingonce the fact-finder decides that the relevant articleis, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder onthe car, how do they separate out the part of theprofits that are attributable to that component from thewhole.And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefedit in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems thatcourts have confronted in other areas of law. One wasutility patent damages, as I described. Another one isdiscussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in theSheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a casewhere the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses becalled on in order to show part one or part two or both?MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very oftenboth.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would thoseexpert witnesses -- who would they be? What would theysay?MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will dependon -- on the circumstances of the case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case.MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someonefamiliar with the industry, someone who had worked inthe industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphonecompany, or someone who is familiar with the market forsmartphones and who could speak to on the first questionhow smartphones are put together, how they aremanufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extentto which the components of a smartphone are separable.And then on the second question, the one1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could bespeaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised inyour question in the Sullivan, which is things likeconsumer surveys, to what extent do the variouscomponents of a smartphone drive consumer demand andcontribute to the value of the phone.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of thethings that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. Idon\\'t understand how that helps on this question. Itwould seem to me the higher the cost, the less itcontributed to profits.MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. ChiefJustice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits fromthe bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each ofthese components, and then what share of the revenue isattributable to each of these components. And then yousay this component ispercent of the cost and20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-upcalculation and try to do it that way.Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimesthat won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation andsaid the total profits on this product are $10 million,1 and we think that the component at issue here, based onexpert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or25 percent.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said basedon expert testimony. What would -- what would they betalking about?MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldoncase that\\'s cited on pageof our brief from thisCourt that was a Copyright Act case but discussed theseproblems sort of generally discussed how you apportionthe portion -- the profits from a movie that areattributable to the script as opposed to the actors orthe directors or other things. And they had experts whowere familiar with the industry and who said the scriptis important but, really, a lot of the value andparticularly for a movie like this comes from otherthings.And there were various expert testimoniesthat gave varying percentages, and the Court ended upsaying that the court below had awardedpercent ofthe total profits from the movie, and this Courtaffirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonableapproximation.We\\'re not -- never going to be able to getto certainty, but on these sorts of profits questionsand these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable27approximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly betterthan awarding all or nothing. And courts have been ableto come to those reasonable approximations by usingexpert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'vediscussed.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could youspeak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as Iunderstand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, thatdistinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'sjust -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body ofthe car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a realquestion as to whether it is being -- the design isbeing applied to the car itself.So how would you go about thinking aboutthat question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, andunder what instructions?MR. FLETCHER: So we think the basicquestion for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article ofmanufacture to which the design has been applied. Wethink the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'sobservation in Gorham. It\\'s 1871, first design patentcase that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thingthat gives the distinctive appearance to an article ofmanufacture.1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bugexample is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be veryeasy. If the patented design is for a refrigeratorlatch, no one is going to think that the latch gives thedistinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator.JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk aboutthe hard cases.MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases,like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s eitherthe body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court fourfactors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if thejury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on thosefactors. And so we say you should compare the scope ofthe patented design as shown in the drawings in thepatent, how prominently that design features in theaccused article, whether there are other conceptuallydistinct innovations or components in the article thatare not part of or associated with the patented design,and finally the physical relationship between thepatented design and the rest of the article.JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, howwould you decide the Beetle case, or what experts wouldyou want to hear?MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- asto the article, what\\'s the article --1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given youthat second option.MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s afactual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear fromexperts who can speak to the question of how is theBeetle put together, and what other parts of the -- theBeetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetleput together? It\\'s put together like every other car.I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whetherthe shape of the body is distinctive or not.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also wantto know, to put it in terms of all four factors, thatthe scope of the claim design covers the whole article,but not the interior of the car. There are designfeatures in the interior that the driver sees thataren\\'t the body of the article.As to the second factor, how prominent isthe design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts infavor of finding that the design does cover the wholearticle.Then the third one is conceptually distinctinnovations, and I think that one cuts the other way.There are going to be lots of other features of the caror innovations in the car -- the engine, the steeringsystem, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you30might want to hear adverse testimony.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the firstpart of the test.MR. FLETCHER: Correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article ofmanufacture.So now take the second part of the test andapply it to the Bug.MR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'vedecided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bugis just the body of the Bug.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.MR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question isthe best way to determine that, at least that I canthink of right now, would be consumer surveys addressedto, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making theirpurchasing decisions based on the look of the car, andto what extent are they instead valuing other thingslike --JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that thatquestion is not relevant to the first question. Inother words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugsbuy them because of the look of the car.MR. FLETCHER: Yes.31JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'sonly relevant at questionrather than at question 1,which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or thewhole car that the design is being applied to?MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s thestatute -- the way the statute reads. It says you getprofits from the article of manufacture. And so,logically, I think the way to approach it would beidentify the article and then let the patent-holder makethe argument that even though the article may be just apart of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s justthe case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sellsit. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder,in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'sselling the whole product, still recover a verysubstantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way.JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is nothelpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought thatnobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they likethe way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think,$1800 when it was first sold in the United States? Whatif it cost $18,000? What if it gotmiles per gallon?What if it broke down every 50 miles?32So if that is a real question, if it is areal question whether the article of manufacture thereis the design or the entire car, gives me pause aboutthe test for determining what is the article ofmanufacture.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that thosethings can be taken into account at the second step ofthe test, if you decide that the relevant design -- therelevant article of manufacture is the body of the car,but for all of the reasons you just pointed out.JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- youwere saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficultquestion. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors todetermine what is the article of manufacture there.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think ifyou\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test forarticle of manufacture also lets some of thoseconsiderations play into that test, because it gets towhether there are other conceptually distinct invasions,or other components of the product unrelated to thedesign.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN33MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:Before I address the Court\\'s many questionsinitiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jurybe instructed under what we and the government believeto be the relevant question -- that is, the factual testof whether the relevant article of manufacture is thearticle as sold or a distinct component of it -- and Ithink it\\'s very clear to address the questions thatJustice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, andMs. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened inthis case.There is no -- whatever you determine theright instruction should be, there is no basis tooverturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case.There were two trials below. In neithertrial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, orwitness testimony, ever identify for the jury anyarticle of manufacture other than the phones themselves.In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner,calculated total profits under 289 only on the phonesthemselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable jurorin these trials could possibly have awarded totalprofits on anything other than the phones, unless thisCourt holds --34JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because thedistrict judge limited them?MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happenedwas, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s apretrial statement that the parties have to file saying,these are -- the phones are the -- the phones wereinfringed. The phones are the things that wereinfringed for purposes of sale, and here is what ourevidence is on total profits from the phone.JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on thispoint. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough questiontrying to figure out what the standard is. Now, whycan\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to yourarguments and theirs, and work it out?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not adifficult -- the record in this case is not difficult.JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'sdifficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'sdifficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side.So if I go through and come to theconclusion, at least, that each side has a goodargument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focuson the question that is of great importance across35industries and leave the application of that and whetherit was properly raised to the lower courts?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this weredifficult, it would be entirely appropriate for thisCourt simply to announce what the law is, which I thinkthere is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'renot suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'tnecessary for the Court to do it.This is a case very much like global tech,when you found that the lower court had applied thewrong standard for intentional infringement, and thenfound that the record -- even -- but under the correcthigher standard, the record admitted no otherconclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that theynever identified to the jury, in either case, anyarticle of manufacture other than the phone. And all oftheir evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based onthe total profits to the phone.JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'llread it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you.JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question onthe general issue, which I think is tough. And thegeneral question that I have is I have been looking fora standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all36quite close; the parties actually in the government arefairly close on this -- but is in a brief for theInternet Association, the software industry. And youknow that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and someothers.MR. WAXMAN: I do.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did isthey went back into history. They have a lot ofdifferent cases which they base the standard on, andthey come to the conclusion, which is a little vague,but that the design where it\\'s been applied to onlypart -- it\\'s on page-- of a multicomponent productand does not drive demand for the entire product, thearticle of manufacture is rightly considered to be onlythe component to which the design applies. And onlyprofit attributable to that component may be awarded.Now, really, to understand it, you have tohave examples -- but antitrust cases are hard tounderstand -- and our rule of reason and people do useexamples. And so that kind of standard, with perhapsexamples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper,you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on thehood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit fromthe car.MR. WAXMAN: Justice --37JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not?MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand yourquestion, and I just want to bookmark the fact that Ihave not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'squestion.JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead andanswer her question. At some point you can come back toit.MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer JusticeGinsburg first and then Justice Breyer.Justice Ginsburg, the only thing thatSamsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened inthe Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report,Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed topresent evidence about that -- about the value of designto the total product as a whole. That wasapportionment, Judge Koh said.He wanted -- he calculated total profitsbased on the phone. And his report then said, well, butI believe that onlypercent of the value of the phoneis due to the design or the design of the iconic frontface of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him todo because that was apportionment.The question -- the only issue with respectto article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in38either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as amatter of law in a multicomponent product, the articleof manufacture must be the portion.They never said that to the jury. They didpropose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed thejury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It alsodirected the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'tapprove it. Now, it just so happens that they preservedno relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'respending an awful lot of time on an issue about what wasraised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raisedbelow, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time toturn to Justice Breyer\\'s question.MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to dothat.Justice Breyer, the -- there is no questionthat in an appropriate case the jury can decide whetherthe article of manufacture to which the design isapplied and to which it provides a distinctive andpleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'sactually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers,or it could be a component of it.In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'sreally not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,39there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question offact for the jury.We believe that the -- the four factors thatthe Solicitor General articulated would be appropriatefactors to consider.I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is thequestion of fact?MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to whichthe law applies? What -- what is the question of fact?MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In acase in which the jury heard evidence as to competingarticles of manufacture, as to what total profits shouldbe applied to, the jury would be told, if you findinfringement, total profits are awarded on the articleof manufacture to which the patented design was appliedfor the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiaror distinctive appearance.You may determine that the article ofmanufacture is the entire product or a distinctcomponent of that product. In making thatdetermination, you may consider, and this would dependon the evidence in the case, among other factors I wouldinclude the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other40things. For example, most importantly the identity ofwhat it is that is typically consumed by purchasers.Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumersto purchase the infringing product thinking it to be thepatentee\\'s product.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m notgrasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to methat the design is applied to the exterior case of thephone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips andwires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And,you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent onsomething that the consumer can\\'t see. And yetCongress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entireprice of the phone.MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded onthe article of manufacture to which the design isapplied.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, thecase is part of it.MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I41think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s importantto understand that design is not a component and thepatented design is not the article of manufacture. Thepatented design is something that\\'s applied to anarticle of manufacture.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well,these -- these little, the chips and all are articles ofmanufacture, right? How is the design of the caseapplied to those chips?MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, ifyou look at, for example, in the early days, when thepatent -- when the design -- when design patents werefirst permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 ofthem were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines andthings like that. Congress -- when Congress said thatyou are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobsoncases, that as an alternative remedy, if there isinfringement of a design -- which, by the way, does nothappen innocently.When there is infringement of a design, thepatentee may choose an alternative remedy which isessentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoesof the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge theprofits from the article to which the design was1 applied.42There\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plentyof working components, but a design is not a component.A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has todecide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have eithera cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shapeof the car, I think that a jury could very well concludethat because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VWBeetle and buys it thinks that they are buying theBeetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringercopied it.The -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documentsin this case, for example, that are recounted in ourbrief, Samsung realized that it faced what thisexecutive called a crisis of design. And the crisis ofdesign was reflected, the documents show, in thetelephone company saying, you have to create somethinglike the iPhone, and a directive came out to createsomething like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losingsales. And in three months --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we goback to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far yourtest has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'sgoing towards. Okay.They suggest two things. Article of43manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have afour-part test. Do you agree that that four-part testwith respect to identifying just the article ofmanufacture?MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveatonly. What -- the factors that the jury will be toldwill depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go tothe -- to the record.MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'msticking with the test.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s thetest.MR. WAXMAN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, becauseit makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybodyelse, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards,are the article of manufacture.Now, the government would say, go to thesecond test, which takes in some of the things that youwere talking about, to figure out how much of theprofits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable tothe shape of the car.Now, as Justice Alito said, some peopledon\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want44just a small car. They want the car that has a certaintrunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons.Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s90 percent of the profits. It may be that the bodyaccounts for onlypercent of the cost of the car, but90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shapeof the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis?That\\'s what I understand the government\\'sanalysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be toldto do, to decide how much value the design is to theproduct being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in anutshell.MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a testthat the government has articulated here at oralargument. It has not been briefed by anybody.The issue of how you calculate total profitson something less than the whole article as sold waswrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit inthe second Piano case, where in the second Piano case,the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test,how do you determine what the article of manufacture is,hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The realdifficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of theprofits from that article of manufacture.The -- the few courts that have addressedthis that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I45think probably makes the most sense and is the leastdifficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what werethe costs of producing that article, that particularsubcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit marginon the product as a whole applied to that littlecomponent?Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, Ithink that\\'s what courts have generally done. And whatit underscores, and in appropriate cases it may beappropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what itunderscores is the very --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get offtrack.MR. WAXMAN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that partof the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'resaying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The governmentis saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, isthat right?MR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correctthat under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to thetotal profits on the sale of the articles of manufactureto which the design has been applied. That isrelatively straightforward when, in a contested case,46the jury concludes that the article of manufacture isthe product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated whenthe jury concludes that the relevant article ofmanufacture, as was the case in the piano cases wherecustomers could choose an array of cases in which to putthe piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure outtotal profits from the manufacture and sale of the case.But the decided cases that I have seen havelooked at the question what was the manufacture -- whatwere the direct costs associated with producing therelevant piano cases and what was the profit margin onthe piano as applied to that.And may I just add one other point which Ithink is still on track. The problem with that is thatit runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congresswas concerned about in 1887 when it passed the DesignPatent Act, because the concern was that counterfeitersand copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the onlycompensation was something that could be viewed as thecost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going toget apercent margin on $2.50 for what it cost toproduce this little component, there would be nodeterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency.Yes, Justice Kagan.JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and Ithink that the VW example is a good example for this47reason -- where the thing that makes the productdistinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s notbeen a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer orsome graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and saidI just have this great idea for an appearance. Butthat\\'s the principal reason why the product has beensuccessful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has todo all the other things that cars do, but the principalreason why the car has been successful has to do withthis particular appearance, the design.As I understood the government, that doesnot come into the first inquiry. That does not comeinto the question of what is the article. It only comesinto the second inquiry, which is how much of theprofits are attributable to that article.Do you agree with that?MR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- Idon\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test asyou have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. Ithink that the government\\'s -- if you look at thegovernment\\'s factors, you know, one factor is therelative prominence of the design within the product asa whole. And the government says that whether thedesign -- in other words, whether the design is a48significant attribute of the entire product affectingthe appearance of the product as a whole would suggestthat the article should be the product.Another factor in the government\\'s test isthe physical relationship between the patented designand the rest of the product. In other words, as thegovernment\\'s brief says, can the user or the sellerphysically separate it, or is it manufacturedseparately.Another factor is whether the design isconceptually different from the product as a whole, as,for example, a design on a book binding is differentfrom the intellectual property reflected in thecopyright material in the book. Those -- we agree withall those factors as relevant, but I do think directly,you know, speaking to the question that you raised, thefirst factor that I mentioned, the relative prominenceof the design within the product of the whole is inessence asking -- and it is a relevant question indetermining the article of manufacture -- whether thepatented design is likely to cause the consumers topurchase the infringing product thinking it to be thepatentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- Ican\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetleexample, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was49similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep ora Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebodywho looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied theiconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well saythat, and a jury would take that into account.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is theapproach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as\"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word?MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. Andif there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- whatword would you use to describe your approach?MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the articleof manufacture, to which the design is applied forpurposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive andpleasing appearance. Apportionment is what theirexpert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying thetotal profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions ofdollars, but I find that only one percent of consumersbuy phones because of the front face of the phone eitheroff or on.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identifiedthe relevant article, then it seems to me necessarilywhat you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'tsee how we can get away from that word.50MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, JusticeKennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" onceyou -- if you -- if the jury answers the question atstepand says no, no, no, the article of manufactureis the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do wedetermine total profits from the sale of that thing?You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment thatlooks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder andwhat is the -- you know, what is the profit margin forthe car or the refrigerator or something like that.That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it ifyou found it.So, you know, in this case it\\'s a littledifficult to figure out what the alternative article ofmanufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court evenbefore the trial judge, they never even suggested whatthe article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent,the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is nothelpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder isknows what the determination must -- what determinationmust be made. The factors are helpful in making thedetermination.Now what you just said about the article ofmanufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is51applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said?MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury isquoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in 1872decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufactureis the thing to which the design is applied for purposesof sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing,attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to findout -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physicalsense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'swhat the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s appliedto the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it ina different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- whereis the design applied? Is it applied to the inside?No. It\\'s applied to the outside.MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, bydefinition, applies to the outside. It has to apply tosomething that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say whatit\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms ofthe physical world, so what is -- what are you talkingabout?MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked todecide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that52this was a patentable design and you find under Gorhamthat it was infringed, what is the thing to which thatdesign was applied to give it a pleasing appearance.Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or thesoftware. It is applied to the phone. Now, they couldif they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to thejury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to theoutside of the phone.MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to theoutside of an article. It has to be applied to theoutside of an article.I see my time is expired. Thank you verymuch.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Miss Sullivan. Four minutes.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say thatall apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'tapportion the value of the design in relation to thearticle. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did53not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article fromthe other articles that make up the product. So we cansegregate article from other articles within theproduct. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to dothat because it allows total profit only from thatarticle of manufacture to which the design has applied.Now, the test that we ask the Court toannounce on remand. As has been discussed, it has twoparts.The first is -- the antecedent question isidentify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimesthat will be very easy if you do it from two mainfactors. What does the patent scope claim, a frontface, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing?And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for theinstruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, weactually asked the jury to be told that where thearticle of manufacture is a case or external housing,that\\'s the article of manufacture.The second question is quantum of profits.And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in sayingthat a lot of the expert determinations about how muchdid the Beetle exterior drive demand will come intoplay, as the government said and we agree, only at thesecond question: What is the quantum of profits fromthe right article of manufacture?54But, Justice Alito, you asked how similarare we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistencyamong juries.We think the answer to the first questioncan be made more consistent and uniform if we focusmainly on two factors: What does the design in thepatent claim: front face, exterior casing holding thefront face? And second, what is the product to which ithas been applied? That will help judges to guidejuries.We think we should have had instruction42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summaryjudgment that the article of manufacture is the frontface, and that could be instructed to the jury.JUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, isthat Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even thoughthey only want to apply it to the front.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem inthe case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed tothe brief I did point to -- that history is mattershere, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponentproduct.55MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell thejury that there is that distinction, I think you eitherdisregard what Congress meant in its statute or youcreate the kind of absurd results that your brief isfull of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked atpage 23, and it says that seems to do it.MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with pageofthe tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why youmust remand in this case.This case was tried under the improper ruleof law. We tried at every juncture to get the correctrule of law adopted. And the district court said, Iforbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re notasking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article ofmanufacture. And we were shut down over and over againon that.So you must remand and tell the nation\\'seconomy that no one can claim a partial design patent ona portion of a front face of an electronic device andcome in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juriesshould be instructed that the article of manufactureeither is the Beetle exterior or there might be, JusticeBreyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary56articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoonmight be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of thespoon. So we say the article of manufacture is thespoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,that\\'s all right.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden ofshowing what is the relevant article? I assume in acase like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leaveyou with the most important disagreement we have withthe government and with Apple, the burden is on theplaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show whatthe article of manufacture is.Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiffto show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed inwhat the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'sburden, as the entire market value rule in the FederalCircuit shows. With respect, we request that youremand -- vacate and remand.Thank you very much, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.The case is submitted.('"

       "'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\\'ll hear argumentfirst this morning in Case No.5-777, SamsungElectronics v. Apple, Incorporated.Ms. Sullivan.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:A smartphone is smart because it containshundreds of thousands of the technologies that make itwork. But the Federal Circuit held that Section89 ofthe Patent Act entitles the holder of a single designpatent on a portion of the appearance of the phone tototal profit on the entire phone.That result makes no sense. A single designpatent on the portion of the appearance of a phoneshould not entitle the design-patent holder to all theprofit on the entire phone.Section89 does not require that result,and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing,Apple and the government now agree that Section89 doesnot require that result. We respectfully ask that theCourt hold that when a design patent claims a design1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a componentof a product, or, to use the language of Section89,when a design patent is applied to an article ofmanufacture within a multi-article product, we requestthat you hold that Section89 entitles thepatent-holder to total profit on the article ofmanufacture to which the design patent is applied, andnot the profits on the total product.JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how toinstruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not thegovernment, both parties kind of leave it up and say,oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simplywouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test.My preference, if -- if I were just makinganother sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies tosee how the -- the extent to which the design affectedthe consumer, and then the jury would have something todo that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlonginto the statute.You can\\'t really have apportionment, so itseems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is tohave a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder examplethat\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which isa little more difficult -- and just follow the -- andjust follow the words of the statute. But it seems tome neither side gives us an instruction to work with.5MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s onething to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --if I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do underyour brief.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not proposea test that simply leaves it to the jury withoutguidance. The instruction we proposed and that wasrejected by the district court appears in the blue briefat page1, and what we would have told the jury is thatthe article of manufacture to which a design has beenapplied is the part or portion of the product as soldthat incorporates or embodies the subject matter of thepatent.So, Justice Kennedy, our test is verysimple.JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I justdon\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the juryroom; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what werespectfully suggest is that there are two parts to thetest for what constitutes an article of manufacture.And to be clear, I\\'m now stressing ourarticle-of-manufacture argument, not the causationargument we gave as an alternative.6As the case comes to the Court, all we askis that you rule in favor of us on article ofmanufacture.And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells uswhat to look at --JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly makesure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --you\\'re saying we should only look to what an article ofmanufacture is and not your other argument that thereshould be apportionment as to any particular article ofmanufacture.MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.We\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve thecase, that a jury should be instructed that total profitmust be profit derived from the article of manufactureto which the design has been applied.And, Your Honor, the statute does supportour test because the statute asks us to look at thearticle of manufacture to which the design has beenapplied.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that inthis -- in this case?MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case itis -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-corneredfront face of a phone.In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular,round-cornered front face of the phone with certainaspect ratio and corner radii.In the D\\'305, it is the display screen onwhich the graphical user interface appears.So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question,the jury should have been instructed either with ourinstruction: Instruction2.1 would have said to thejury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article ofmanufacture here, but it may be less than the entirephone. The article of manufacture may be a part orportion of the phone, and you should look at two things,Your Honor.You should look at the patent, and, JusticeKennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look atthe -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought tolook at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patentis going to be the best guide to what the design isapplied to in many, many cases, as in this case.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seemto be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter oflaw, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matterof law.1 I believe that your basic argument, everyoneis in agreement, that the test is an article ofmanufacture for purposes of sale.But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, howdo we announce the right test for that? Because thephone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumeras being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. Thatmight be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know.Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how tofigure out the component part. I don\\'t know where inthe record you would have enough to survive yourargument.MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me backup and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence.The -- the test -- and I want to agree withYour Honor. To be clear, we say that what the FederalCircuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrongas a matter of law to hold that the entire product isnecessarily the article of manufacture from which youmeasure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law,but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has tohold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law.It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question ofeither fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrelquestion of law and fact.1 And why does it involve both? Because weknow that district courts look at patents. You assignthem that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. Andwhen they look at a patent for a claim construction,we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar.The district court can look at the patentand say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. Thisisn\\'t one of Apple\\'sother patents on other parts ofthe phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of theentire case. This is the front face patent.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how wouldyou determine the profit attributable to the relevantarticle of manufacture?MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor.First, through ordinary accounting thatwould look to the cost of goods sold in relation torevenues for the relevant component.You could look, if -- if a company buys thecomponent from an original equipment manufacturer, youwould look to their profit margins and apply that.If, as sometimes happens within a company,one division makes the glass front face and anotherdivision makes the innards of the phone, you would findout the transfer pricing between the divisions.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent onthe inner parts and a hundred million was spent on theface, then it\\'s a0:1 ratio.MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, YourHonor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have experttestimony on all of that.MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would.And you would -- but that\\'s just one way.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you hada case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some ofthe briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetledesign was done in three days, and it was a stroke ofgenius and it identified the car. Then it seems to methat that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give threedays\\' profit, but then it took00,000 hours to developthe motor.MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s whatwe would do with the Beetle.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- itseems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing.MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. Toanswer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove thetotal profit from the relevant article of manufactureshere, the front face, or the display screen. One couldhave been accounting. One could have been consumerdemand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested.Apple could have said well, people really like the frontface disproportionately to all the other parts of thephone, so they could have used consumer survey evidenceto prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence orindirect evidence through consumer survey. But, YourHonor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the totalprofit from the article of manufacture may sometimes bea substantial part of the total profit on the product.Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool,shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette.It may be that the article of manufacture to which thedesign patent is applied is just the exterior body ofthe car, but it may be that nobody really wants to paymuch for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle.They want to pay for the cool way it looks.If that\\'s so, it should be open to thepatent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits comefrom the exterior of the car.JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference inpractical terms between that and your causation argumentor apportionment?12MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?MS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concedeunder article of manufacture that the holder of thepatent gets profit from the article, even if the profitdoes not come entirely from the design.Let me give you an example with a phone\\'sfront face. Consumers may value the front face becauseit\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,because it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give thepatent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test allthe profits for the front face, even if it includesprofit from those non-design features of the front face,where the pure apportionment test or pure causation testwould limit the profits to the profits from the designparts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,that\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting alittle more with article of manufacture than we do witha pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happyfor that.But the reason we think it\\'s consistent withCongress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congresswas trying to do was provide a rule that givesdesign-patent holders total profit from the article ofmanufacture.13That\\'s a little bit overinclusive, becauseif you get total profit on the rugs that were at issuein the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from thedesign, and there will be a little extra you\\'re gettingperhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congresswas entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to saythat it is appropriate as a matter of causation to saythat design causes value in a single article productlike a rug.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at thisrecord, and they were claiming the profits on the wholephone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, theywere saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --this was their argument to the jury and it sold theFederal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,that, you know, all smartphones basically function thesame. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.This is what they were arguing, and they put on anexpert that gave total profits. If the jury creditedthem, could you -- and you were properly -- it was aproperly instructed jury, could you overturn thatfinding?MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back tothe proper instruction. The jury was not properlyinstructed here.14JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,Miss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --MS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. Ifthe article of manufacture was the entire ornamentalappearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent onthe entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assertit here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phonedoes not look substantially similar to the entireoutside of a Samsung phone. The reason why designpatencies carve the product up into multiple partialdesign claims is so they can make a narrow infringementargument and find a little sliver of the phone on whichinfringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate togive total profit when they do that.So, Your Honor, if there had been a designpatent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Applecould have tried to get total profit on the entire case.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properlyinstructed jury on the evidence presented in this casecould not have found for Apple. Is that what --MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.That is very much our position.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the juryinstruction, what was the legal error?15MS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in thejury instruction --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides aproperly instructed jury, could they have found in favorof Apple on the evidence presented?MS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,because --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides thejury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a properinstruction was given -- what would have been the legalerror?MS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- noreasonable jury could have found on this record that theentire product was the article of manufacture to whichthe design has been applied. Two reasons.One, design patents cover ornamentalappearance. They cannot, by definition, cover theinnards of the phone. So the functional innards of thephone cannot be part of what is claimed by the designpatent.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claimthe design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover theinnards, but you just admitted that a jury could findits -- could find that the consumers and others would1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looksonly.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talkingabout design patents, not trademark or copyright.There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here onthe -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree withyou, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answeryour question as precisely as I can. Just because youcan show that most of the profit comes from the Beetleexterior does not mean the car is the article ofmanufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test.First, determine what is the article ofmanufacture.Then second step, determine the quantum ofdamages, quantum of profits in this case, from thatarticle.Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almostall its profits from the exterior case, people wereindifferent to whether they could read their e-mail,navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If youcould prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'thappen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvetteor the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion ofthe total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at thetrial, propose basing damages on profits from an articleless than the whole phone?MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. Andwe were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the juryinstruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began,we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket322. We saidvery clearly article of manufacture is less than thetotal phone and profit should be limited to the profitfrom the article. We said again in the juryinstructions -- and here I would refer you respectfullyto joint Appendix06,07 and to the result of that onpetition Appendix65A. What happened is we went to thecourt and we said please listen to us about article ofmanufacture, if you only get the total profit on thearticle. The district court said, no, I already said noapportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said noapportionment, she shut us out of both theories. Thedistrict court shut us out of article of manufacture asthe basis for total profit, and it shut us out ofcausation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here.So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, ourcharge conference. And then again in our0A and the1 key rulings on0A at the close of evidence, we againsaid article is separate from apportionment, and thearticle here is less than the phone. At97 we saidat -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is lessthan the phone. And in the0B at the close of thefirst trial, we again said article is less than thephone.Second trial happens on certain phones.Again, in the0A and the0B, the trial court saysagain, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment fordesign patents. You cannot talk to me about article ofmanufacture. We tried over and over and over again toget the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and wewere rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor?Because there was evidence in the case from which areasonable, properly instructed jury could have foundthat the components were the front face, the front face,and the display screen. And the evidence came out ofApple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled torely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again andagain said what are you claiming. And when thewitnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'tsay the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'reclaiming a very specific front face, and by the way,ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignoreeverything that\\'s outside the dotted lines.And if I could just remind you that we\\'vereprinted the patents for you to see, and they may looklike an iPhone on page, which is the D\\'677. They maylook like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was inBlueberry, set, but the claim is not for the iPhone.The claim is for the small portion of the externalappearance of the phone that is inside the solid line.Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. Itdisclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines.And Your Honor, the question for the jurywas not did people think that the look and feel of aniPhone was great. The question for the jury was did thevery small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makeslook substantially similar to the very small portion ofthe patent claim?Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis inthis record for a conclusion that the entire product,profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profitfrom those articles. What Apple should have done isdone either of the two things we discussed earlier,accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goodssold on the components, or it should have done consumersurvey evidence like our expert did.1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General hasproposed a test with four factors to determine thearticle question. Do you agree with those? Are thereothers you would add?MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answerbriefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time.We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test.We propose a briefer test that we think is moreadministrable. We propose that you look to two factors:The design in the patent and the accused product. Wethink our test is more administrable, and it can oftenbe done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do inMarkman, who will then instruct the jury and give themguidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further onrebuttal. Thank you very much.I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time,Mr. Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Fletcher.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHERFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTYMR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:This case presents two related questionsabout the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for21design-patent infringement under Section89. If Iunderstood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentationcorrectly, the parties are now in agreement about bothof those legal questions.Just to summarize briefly, first, the courtof appeals correctly held that Section89\\'s provisionfor an award of total profits means that thepatent-holder can recover all of the profits from thesale of the infringing articles and manufacture and notjust the portion of the profits that the patent-holdercan prove was caused by or attributable to the design asopposed to other features of the article.But second, we read the court of appeals\\'opinion to have held that the relevant article ofmanufacture for which profits are owed is always theentire product that the infringer sells to customers.And we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand allparties to agree with that now.Instead, the relevant article of manufactureto which a patented design may be applied will sometimesbe a part or a component of a larger product sold incommerce. And when that is the case, all parties nowagree that the patent-holder is entitled only to theprofits from that infringing article and not to all --1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when thecomponent -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t soldapart from the entire product, how should the -- thejudge charge the jury on determining the profitattributable to the infringing article?MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d betwo factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed.The first one would be what is the relevant article, andthere may be a dispute on that as there is in this case.The second question, once the fact-finderidentifies the relevant article, is the question thatyou asked, which is how much of the total profits fromthe device are attributable to the infringing article?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step,and how do you figure it out?JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he completehis answer to my question?MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on thesecond step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in alot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in thiscase. This case sort of stopped at the first step. Butwe think that courts could sensibly look to the way thatcourts have handled other analogous questions, and Ipoint to two areas of law where that\\'s happened.The first is utility patent damages under1 the Patent Act, before946, permitted an award of theinfringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often apatent would apply to part of a larger product sold incommerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitledto the profits that are attributable to the infringingpart, but not the whole machine.JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- JusticeGinsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her,adequately summarized, the test that you propose atpageof your brief relevant considerations include?MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test wepropose at pagegoes to the first of the two questionsthat I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article ofmanufacture to which the design has been applied? Oncethe fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the testthat we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to beJustice Sotomayor\\'s question.I understood Justice Ginsburg to be askingonce the fact-finder decides that the relevant articleis, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder onthe car, how do they separate out the part of theprofits that are attributable to that component from thewhole.And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefedit in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems thatcourts have confronted in other areas of law. One wasutility patent damages, as I described. Another one isdiscussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in theSheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a casewhere the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses becalled on in order to show part one or part two or both?MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very oftenboth.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would thoseexpert witnesses -- who would they be? What would theysay?MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will dependon -- on the circumstances of the case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case.MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someonefamiliar with the industry, someone who had worked inthe industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphonecompany, or someone who is familiar with the market forsmartphones and who could speak to on the first questionhow smartphones are put together, how they aremanufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extentto which the components of a smartphone are separable.And then on the second question, the one1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could bespeaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised inyour question in the Sullivan, which is things likeconsumer surveys, to what extent do the variouscomponents of a smartphone drive consumer demand andcontribute to the value of the phone.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of thethings that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. Idon\\'t understand how that helps on this question. Itwould seem to me the higher the cost, the less itcontributed to profits.MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. ChiefJustice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits fromthe bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each ofthese components, and then what share of the revenue isattributable to each of these components. And then yousay this component ispercent of the cost and20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-upcalculation and try to do it that way.Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimesthat won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation andsaid the total profits on this product are $10 million,1 and we think that the component at issue here, based onexpert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or25 percent.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said basedon expert testimony. What would -- what would they betalking about?MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldoncase that\\'s cited on pageof our brief from thisCourt that was a Copyright Act case but discussed theseproblems sort of generally discussed how you apportionthe portion -- the profits from a movie that areattributable to the script as opposed to the actors orthe directors or other things. And they had experts whowere familiar with the industry and who said the scriptis important but, really, a lot of the value andparticularly for a movie like this comes from otherthings.And there were various expert testimoniesthat gave varying percentages, and the Court ended upsaying that the court below had awardedpercent ofthe total profits from the movie, and this Courtaffirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonableapproximation.We\\'re not -- never going to be able to getto certainty, but on these sorts of profits questionsand these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable27approximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly betterthan awarding all or nothing. And courts have been ableto come to those reasonable approximations by usingexpert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'vediscussed.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could youspeak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as Iunderstand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, thatdistinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'sjust -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body ofthe car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a realquestion as to whether it is being -- the design isbeing applied to the car itself.So how would you go about thinking aboutthat question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, andunder what instructions?MR. FLETCHER: So we think the basicquestion for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article ofmanufacture to which the design has been applied. Wethink the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'sobservation in Gorham. It\\'s871, first design patentcase that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thingthat gives the distinctive appearance to an article ofmanufacture.1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bugexample is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be veryeasy. If the patented design is for a refrigeratorlatch, no one is going to think that the latch gives thedistinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator.JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk aboutthe hard cases.MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases,like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s eitherthe body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court fourfactors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if thejury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on thosefactors. And so we say you should compare the scope ofthe patented design as shown in the drawings in thepatent, how prominently that design features in theaccused article, whether there are other conceptuallydistinct innovations or components in the article thatare not part of or associated with the patented design,and finally the physical relationship between thepatented design and the rest of the article.JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, howwould you decide the Beetle case, or what experts wouldyou want to hear?MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- asto the article, what\\'s the article --1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given youthat second option.MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s afactual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear fromexperts who can speak to the question of how is theBeetle put together, and what other parts of the -- theBeetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetleput together? It\\'s put together like every other car.I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whetherthe shape of the body is distinctive or not.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also wantto know, to put it in terms of all four factors, thatthe scope of the claim design covers the whole article,but not the interior of the car. There are designfeatures in the interior that the driver sees thataren\\'t the body of the article.As to the second factor, how prominent isthe design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts infavor of finding that the design does cover the wholearticle.Then the third one is conceptually distinctinnovations, and I think that one cuts the other way.There are going to be lots of other features of the caror innovations in the car -- the engine, the steeringsystem, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you30might want to hear adverse testimony.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the firstpart of the test.MR. FLETCHER: Correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article ofmanufacture.So now take the second part of the test andapply it to the Bug.MR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'vedecided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bugis just the body of the Bug.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.MR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question isthe best way to determine that, at least that I canthink of right now, would be consumer surveys addressedto, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making theirpurchasing decisions based on the look of the car, andto what extent are they instead valuing other thingslike --JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that thatquestion is not relevant to the first question. Inother words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugsbuy them because of the look of the car.MR. FLETCHER: Yes.31JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'sonly relevant at questionrather than at question,which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or thewhole car that the design is being applied to?MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s thestatute -- the way the statute reads. It says you getprofits from the article of manufacture. And so,logically, I think the way to approach it would beidentify the article and then let the patent-holder makethe argument that even though the article may be just apart of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s justthe case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sellsit. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder,in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'sselling the whole product, still recover a verysubstantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way.JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is nothelpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought thatnobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they likethe way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think,$1800 when it was first sold in the United States? Whatif it cost $18,000? What if it gotmiles per gallon?What if it broke down every0 miles?32So if that is a real question, if it is areal question whether the article of manufacture thereis the design or the entire car, gives me pause aboutthe test for determining what is the article ofmanufacture.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that thosethings can be taken into account at the second step ofthe test, if you decide that the relevant design -- therelevant article of manufacture is the body of the car,but for all of the reasons you just pointed out.JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- youwere saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficultquestion. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors todetermine what is the article of manufacture there.MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think ifyou\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test forarticle of manufacture also lets some of thoseconsiderations play into that test, because it gets towhether there are other conceptually distinct invasions,or other components of the product unrelated to thedesign.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN33MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:Before I address the Court\\'s many questionsinitiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jurybe instructed under what we and the government believeto be the relevant question -- that is, the factual testof whether the relevant article of manufacture is thearticle as sold or a distinct component of it -- and Ithink it\\'s very clear to address the questions thatJustice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, andMs. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened inthis case.There is no -- whatever you determine theright instruction should be, there is no basis tooverturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case.There were two trials below. In neithertrial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, orwitness testimony, ever identify for the jury anyarticle of manufacture other than the phones themselves.In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner,calculated total profits under89 only on the phonesthemselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable jurorin these trials could possibly have awarded totalprofits on anything other than the phones, unless thisCourt holds --34JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because thedistrict judge limited them?MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happenedwas, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s apretrial statement that the parties have to file saying,these are -- the phones are the -- the phones wereinfringed. The phones are the things that wereinfringed for purposes of sale, and here is what ourevidence is on total profits from the phone.JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on thispoint. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough questiontrying to figure out what the standard is. Now, whycan\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to yourarguments and theirs, and work it out?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not adifficult -- the record in this case is not difficult.JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'sdifficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'sdifficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side.So if I go through and come to theconclusion, at least, that each side has a goodargument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focuson the question that is of great importance across35industries and leave the application of that and whetherit was properly raised to the lower courts?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this weredifficult, it would be entirely appropriate for thisCourt simply to announce what the law is, which I thinkthere is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'renot suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'tnecessary for the Court to do it.This is a case very much like global tech,when you found that the lower court had applied thewrong standard for intentional infringement, and thenfound that the record -- even -- but under the correcthigher standard, the record admitted no otherconclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that theynever identified to the jury, in either case, anyarticle of manufacture other than the phone. And all oftheir evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based onthe total profits to the phone.JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'llread it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you.JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question onthe general issue, which I think is tough. And thegeneral question that I have is I have been looking fora standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all36quite close; the parties actually in the government arefairly close on this -- but is in a brief for theInternet Association, the software industry. And youknow that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and someothers.MR. WAXMAN: I do.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did isthey went back into history. They have a lot ofdifferent cases which they base the standard on, andthey come to the conclusion, which is a little vague,but that the design where it\\'s been applied to onlypart -- it\\'s on page-- of a multicomponent productand does not drive demand for the entire product, thearticle of manufacture is rightly considered to be onlythe component to which the design applies. And onlyprofit attributable to that component may be awarded.Now, really, to understand it, you have tohave examples -- but antitrust cases are hard tounderstand -- and our rule of reason and people do useexamples. And so that kind of standard, with perhapsexamples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper,you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on thehood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit fromthe car.MR. WAXMAN: Justice --37JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not?MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand yourquestion, and I just want to bookmark the fact that Ihave not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'squestion.JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead andanswer her question. At some point you can come back toit.MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer JusticeGinsburg first and then Justice Breyer.Justice Ginsburg, the only thing thatSamsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened inthe Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report,Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed topresent evidence about that -- about the value of designto the total product as a whole. That wasapportionment, Judge Koh said.He wanted -- he calculated total profitsbased on the phone. And his report then said, well, butI believe that onlypercent of the value of the phoneis due to the design or the design of the iconic frontface of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him todo because that was apportionment.The question -- the only issue with respectto article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in38either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as amatter of law in a multicomponent product, the articleof manufacture must be the portion.They never said that to the jury. They didpropose a jury instruction,2.1, which directed thejury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It alsodirected the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'tapprove it. Now, it just so happens that they preservedno relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'respending an awful lot of time on an issue about what wasraised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raisedbelow, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time toturn to Justice Breyer\\'s question.MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to dothat.Justice Breyer, the -- there is no questionthat in an appropriate case the jury can decide whetherthe article of manufacture to which the design isapplied and to which it provides a distinctive andpleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'sactually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers,or it could be a component of it.In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'sreally not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,39there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question offact for the jury.We believe that the -- the four factors thatthe Solicitor General articulated would be appropriatefactors to consider.I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is thequestion of fact?MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to whichthe law applies? What -- what is the question of fact?MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In acase in which the jury heard evidence as to competingarticles of manufacture, as to what total profits shouldbe applied to, the jury would be told, if you findinfringement, total profits are awarded on the articleof manufacture to which the patented design was appliedfor the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiaror distinctive appearance.You may determine that the article ofmanufacture is the entire product or a distinctcomponent of that product. In making thatdetermination, you may consider, and this would dependon the evidence in the case, among other factors I wouldinclude the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other40things. For example, most importantly the identity ofwhat it is that is typically consumed by purchasers.Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumersto purchase the infringing product thinking it to be thepatentee\\'s product.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m notgrasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to methat the design is applied to the exterior case of thephone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips andwires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And,you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent onsomething that the consumer can\\'t see. And yetCongress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entireprice of the phone.MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded onthe article of manufacture to which the design isapplied.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, thecase is part of it.MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I41think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s importantto understand that design is not a component and thepatented design is not the article of manufacture. Thepatented design is something that\\'s applied to anarticle of manufacture.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well,these -- these little, the chips and all are articles ofmanufacture, right? How is the design of the caseapplied to those chips?MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, ifyou look at, for example, in the early days, when thepatent -- when the design -- when design patents werefirst permitted by statute in842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued,5 ofthem were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines andthings like that. Congress -- when Congress said thatyou are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobsoncases, that as an alternative remedy, if there isinfringement of a design -- which, by the way, does nothappen innocently.When there is infringement of a design, thepatentee may choose an alternative remedy which isessentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoesof the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge theprofits from the article to which the design was1 applied.42There\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plentyof working components, but a design is not a component.A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has todecide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have eithera cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shapeof the car, I think that a jury could very well concludethat because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VWBeetle and buys it thinks that they are buying theBeetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringercopied it.The -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documentsin this case, for example, that are recounted in ourbrief, Samsung realized that it faced what thisexecutive called a crisis of design. And the crisis ofdesign was reflected, the documents show, in thetelephone company saying, you have to create somethinglike the iPhone, and a directive came out to createsomething like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losingsales. And in three months --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we goback to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far yourtest has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'sgoing towards. Okay.They suggest two things. Article of43manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have afour-part test. Do you agree that that four-part testwith respect to identifying just the article ofmanufacture?MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveatonly. What -- the factors that the jury will be toldwill depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go tothe -- to the record.MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'msticking with the test.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s thetest.MR. WAXMAN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, becauseit makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybodyelse, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards,are the article of manufacture.Now, the government would say, go to thesecond test, which takes in some of the things that youwere talking about, to figure out how much of theprofits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable tothe shape of the car.Now, as Justice Alito said, some peopledon\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want44just a small car. They want the car that has a certaintrunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons.Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s90 percent of the profits. It may be that the bodyaccounts for onlypercent of the cost of the car, but90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shapeof the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis?That\\'s what I understand the government\\'sanalysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be toldto do, to decide how much value the design is to theproduct being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in anutshell.MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a testthat the government has articulated here at oralargument. It has not been briefed by anybody.The issue of how you calculate total profitson something less than the whole article as sold waswrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit inthe second Piano case, where in the second Piano case,the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test,how do you determine what the article of manufacture is,hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The realdifficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of theprofits from that article of manufacture.The -- the few courts that have addressedthis that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I45think probably makes the most sense and is the leastdifficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what werethe costs of producing that article, that particularsubcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit marginon the product as a whole applied to that littlecomponent?Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, Ithink that\\'s what courts have generally done. And whatit underscores, and in appropriate cases it may beappropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what itunderscores is the very --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get offtrack.MR. WAXMAN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that partof the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'resaying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The governmentis saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, isthat right?MR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correctthat under Section89 the patentee is entitled to thetotal profits on the sale of the articles of manufactureto which the design has been applied. That isrelatively straightforward when, in a contested case,46the jury concludes that the article of manufacture isthe product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated whenthe jury concludes that the relevant article ofmanufacture, as was the case in the piano cases wherecustomers could choose an array of cases in which to putthe piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure outtotal profits from the manufacture and sale of the case.But the decided cases that I have seen havelooked at the question what was the manufacture -- whatwere the direct costs associated with producing therelevant piano cases and what was the profit margin onthe piano as applied to that.And may I just add one other point which Ithink is still on track. The problem with that is thatit runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congresswas concerned about in887 when it passed the DesignPatent Act, because the concern was that counterfeitersand copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the onlycompensation was something that could be viewed as thecost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going toget apercent margin on $2.50 for what it cost toproduce this little component, there would be nodeterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency.Yes, Justice Kagan.JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and Ithink that the VW example is a good example for this47reason -- where the thing that makes the productdistinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s notbeen a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer orsome graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and saidI just have this great idea for an appearance. Butthat\\'s the principal reason why the product has beensuccessful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has todo all the other things that cars do, but the principalreason why the car has been successful has to do withthis particular appearance, the design.As I understood the government, that doesnot come into the first inquiry. That does not comeinto the question of what is the article. It only comesinto the second inquiry, which is how much of theprofits are attributable to that article.Do you agree with that?MR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- Idon\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test asyou have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. Ithink that the government\\'s -- if you look at thegovernment\\'s factors, you know, one factor is therelative prominence of the design within the product asa whole. And the government says that whether thedesign -- in other words, whether the design is a48significant attribute of the entire product affectingthe appearance of the product as a whole would suggestthat the article should be the product.Another factor in the government\\'s test isthe physical relationship between the patented designand the rest of the product. In other words, as thegovernment\\'s brief says, can the user or the sellerphysically separate it, or is it manufacturedseparately.Another factor is whether the design isconceptually different from the product as a whole, as,for example, a design on a book binding is differentfrom the intellectual property reflected in thecopyright material in the book. Those -- we agree withall those factors as relevant, but I do think directly,you know, speaking to the question that you raised, thefirst factor that I mentioned, the relative prominenceof the design within the product of the whole is inessence asking -- and it is a relevant question indetermining the article of manufacture -- whether thepatented design is likely to cause the consumers topurchase the infringing product thinking it to be thepatentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- Ican\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetleexample, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was49similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep ora Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebodywho looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied theiconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well saythat, and a jury would take that into account.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is theapproach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as\"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word?MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. Andif there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- whatword would you use to describe your approach?MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the articleof manufacture, to which the design is applied forpurposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive andpleasing appearance. Apportionment is what theirexpert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying thetotal profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions ofdollars, but I find that only one percent of consumersbuy phones because of the front face of the phone eitheroff or on.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identifiedthe relevant article, then it seems to me necessarilywhat you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'tsee how we can get away from that word.50MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, JusticeKennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" onceyou -- if you -- if the jury answers the question atstepand says no, no, no, the article of manufactureis the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do wedetermine total profits from the sale of that thing?You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment thatlooks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder andwhat is the -- you know, what is the profit margin forthe car or the refrigerator or something like that.That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it ifyou found it.So, you know, in this case it\\'s a littledifficult to figure out what the alternative article ofmanufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court evenbefore the trial judge, they never even suggested whatthe article of manufacture could be for the05 patent,the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is nothelpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder isknows what the determination must -- what determinationmust be made. The factors are helpful in making thedetermination.Now what you just said about the article ofmanufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is51applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said?MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury isquoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in872decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufactureis the thing to which the design is applied for purposesof sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing,attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to findout -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physicalsense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'swhat the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s appliedto the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it ina different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- whereis the design applied? Is it applied to the inside?No. It\\'s applied to the outside.MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, bydefinition, applies to the outside. It has to apply tosomething that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say whatit\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms ofthe physical world, so what is -- what are you talkingabout?MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked todecide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that52this was a patentable design and you find under Gorhamthat it was infringed, what is the thing to which thatdesign was applied to give it a pleasing appearance.Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or thesoftware. It is applied to the phone. Now, they couldif they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to thejury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to theoutside of the phone.MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to theoutside of an article. It has to be applied to theoutside of an article.I see my time is expired. Thank you verymuch.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Miss Sullivan. Four minutes.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say thatall apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'tapportion the value of the design in relation to thearticle. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did53not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article fromthe other articles that make up the product. So we cansegregate article from other articles within theproduct. And, in fact, Section89 requires us to dothat because it allows total profit only from thatarticle of manufacture to which the design has applied.Now, the test that we ask the Court toannounce on remand. As has been discussed, it has twoparts.The first is -- the antecedent question isidentify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimesthat will be very easy if you do it from two mainfactors. What does the patent scope claim, a frontface, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing?And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for theinstruction, you allude to it, blue brief1, weactually asked the jury to be told that where thearticle of manufacture is a case or external housing,that\\'s the article of manufacture.The second question is quantum of profits.And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in sayingthat a lot of the expert determinations about how muchdid the Beetle exterior drive demand will come intoplay, as the government said and we agree, only at thesecond question: What is the quantum of profits fromthe right article of manufacture?54But, Justice Alito, you asked how similarare we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistencyamong juries.We think the answer to the first questioncan be made more consistent and uniform if we focusmainly on two factors: What does the design in thepatent claim: front face, exterior casing holding thefront face? And second, what is the product to which ithas been applied? That will help judges to guidejuries.We think we should have had instruction42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summaryjudgment that the article of manufacture is the frontface, and that could be instructed to the jury.JUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, isthat Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even thoughthey only want to apply it to the front.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem inthe case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed tothe brief I did point to -- that history is mattershere, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponentproduct.55MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell thejury that there is that distinction, I think you eitherdisregard what Congress meant in its statute or youcreate the kind of absurd results that your brief isfull of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for.MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked atpage3, and it says that seems to do it.MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with pageofthe tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why youmust remand in this case.This case was tried under the improper ruleof law. We tried at every juncture to get the correctrule of law adopted. And the district court said, Iforbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re notasking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article ofmanufacture. And we were shut down over and over againon that.So you must remand and tell the nation\\'seconomy that no one can claim a partial design patent ona portion of a front face of an electronic device andcome in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juriesshould be instructed that the article of manufactureeither is the Beetle exterior or there might be, JusticeBreyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary56articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoonmight be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of thespoon. So we say the article of manufacture is thespoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,that\\'s all right.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden ofshowing what is the relevant article? I assume in acase like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leaveyou with the most important disagreement we have withthe government and with Apple, the burden is on theplaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show whatthe article of manufacture is.Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiffto show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed inwhat the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'sburden, as the entire market value rule in the FederalCircuit shows. With respect, we request that youremand -- vacate and remand.Thank you very much, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.The case is submitted.('"

       " ' Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:A smartphone is smart because it containshundreds of thousands of the technologies that make itwork. But the Federal Circuit held that Section89 ofthe Patent Act entitles the holder of a single designpatent on a portion of the appearance of the phone tototal profit on the entire phone.That result makes no sense. A single designpatent on the portion of the appearance of a phoneshould not entitle the design-patent holder to all theprofit on the entire phone.Section89 does not require that result,and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing,Apple and the government now agree that Section89 doesnot require that result. We respectfully ask that theCourt hold that when a design patent claims a design1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a componentof a product, or, to use the language of Section89,when a design patent is applied to an article ofmanufacture within a multi-article product, we requestthat you hold that Section89 entitles thepatent-holder to total profit on the article ofmanufacture to which the design patent is applied, andnot the profits on the total product',\n",

If I were the juror, I simplywouldn't know what to do under your -- under your test.My preference, if -- if I were just makinganother sensible rule, is we'd have market studies tosee how the -- the extent to which the design affectedthe consumer, and then the jury would have something todo that. But that's apportionment, which runs headlonginto the statute.You can't really have apportionment, so itseems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is tohave a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder examplethat's in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which isa little more difficult -- and just follow the -- andjust follow the words of the statute.

There's an article ofmanufacture here, but it may be less than the entirephone. The article of manufacture may be a part orportion of the phone, and you should look at two things,Your Honor.You should look at the patent, and, JusticeKennedy, with respect -- you shouldn't just look atthe -- at the phones in the jury room.

Because thephone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumeras being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. Thatmight be what drives the sale.

To be clear, we say that what the FederalCircuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrongas a matter of law to hold that the entire product isnecessarily the article of manufacture from which youmeasure total profit. That's wrong as a matter of law,but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has tohold we're right on the article as a matter of law.It's an -- it's a -- it's a question ofeither fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrelquestion of law and fact.1 And why does it involve both? Because weknow that district courts look at patents. You assignthem that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. Andwhen they look at a patent for a claim construction,we're asking for part of the test to be very similar.The district court can look at the patentand say, oh, this is Apple's front face patent.

In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let's -13 let's assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some ofthe briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetledesign was done in three days, and it was a stroke ofgenius and it identified the car.

       " \" It's not, Your Honor. Toanswer Justice Ginsburg's question, there are three ways1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove thetotal profit from the relevant article of manufactureshere, the front face, or the display screen. One couldhave been accounting. One could have been consumerdemand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested.Apple could have said well, people really like the frontface disproportionately to all the other parts of thephone, so they could have used consumer survey evidenceto prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence orindirect evidence through consumer survey. But, YourHonor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the totalprofit from the article of manufacture may sometimes bea substantial part of the total profit on the product.Let's take the Beetle, or let's take a cool,shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette.It may be that the article of manufacture to which thedesign patent is applied is just the exterior body ofthe car, but it may be that nobody really wants to paymuch for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle.They want to pay for the cool way it looks.If that's so, it should be open to thepatent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits comefrom the exterior of the car\",\n",

       " \" The difference is we concedeunder article of manufacture that the holder of thepatent gets profit from the article, even if the profitdoes not come entirely from the design.Let me give you an example with a phone'sfront face. Consumers may value the front face becauseit's scratch-resistant, because it's water-resistant,because it's shatterproof. We're going to give thepatent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test allthe profits for the front face, even if it includesprofit from those non-design features of the front face,where the pure apportionment test or pure causation testwould limit the profits to the profits from the designparts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,that's a little bit overinclusive. We're getting alittle more with article of manufacture than we do witha pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happyfor that.But the reason we think it's consistent withCongress's purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congresswas trying to do was provide a rule that givesdesign-patent holders total profit from the article ofmanufacture.13That's a little bit overinclusive, becauseif you get total profit on the rugs that were at issuein the Dobson cases, you'll get a little profit from thedesign, and there will be a little extra you're gettingperhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congresswas entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to saythat it is appropriate as a matter of causation to saythat design causes value in a single article productlike a rug\",\n",

People don't really put much value on the unit.This is what they were arguing, and they put on anexpert that gave total profits.

Because the entire outside of a Samsung phonedoes not look substantially similar to the entireoutside of a Samsung phone. The reason why designpatencies carve the product up into multiple partialdesign claims is so they can make a narrow infringementargument and find a little sliver of the phone on whichinfringement can be found, and it's inappropriate togive total profit when they do that.So, Your Honor, if there had been a designpatent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Applecould have tried to get total profit on the entire case\",\n",

       " \" Six times, Your Honor. Andwe were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the juryinstruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began,we submitted a legal brief. It's Docket322. We saidvery clearly article of manufacture is less than thetotal phone and profit should be limited to the profitfrom the article. We said again in the juryinstructions -- and here I would refer you respectfullyto joint Appendix06,07 and to the result of that onpetition Appendix65A. What happened is we went to thecourt and we said please listen to us about article ofmanufacture, if you only get the total profit on thearticle. The district court said, no, I already said noapportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said noapportionment, she shut us out of both theories. Thedistrict court shut us out of article of manufacture asthe basis for total profit, and it shut us out ofcausation or apportionment, which we don't press here.So that's twice. Our legal brief, ourcharge conference. And then again in our0A and the1 key rulings on0A at the close of evidence, we againsaid article is separate from apportionment, and thearticle here is less than the phone. At97 we saidat -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is lessthan the phone. And in the0B at the close of thefirst trial, we again said article is less than thephone.Second trial happens on certain phones.Again, in the0A and the0B, the trial court saysagain, I have ruled that there's no apportionment fordesign patents. You cannot talk to me about article ofmanufacture. We tried over and over and over again toget the article of manufacture's theory embraced, and wewere rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor?Because there was evidence in the case from which areasonable, properly instructed jury could have foundthat the components were the front face, the front face,and the display screen. And the evidence came out ofApple's own witnesses, which we're certainly entitled torely on. Your Honor, Apple's own witnesses again andagain said what are you claiming. And when thewitnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn'tsay the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we'reclaiming a very specific front face, and by the way,ignore the home button. We're claiming a very specific1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignoreeverything that's outside the dotted lines.And if I could just remind you that we'vereprinted the patents for you to see, and they may looklike an iPhone on page, which is the D'677. They maylook like an iPhone in the D'087, which was inBlueberry, set, but the claim is not for the iPhone.The claim is for the small portion of the externalappearance of the phone that is inside the solid line.Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. Itdisclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines.And Your Honor, the question for the jurywas not did people think that the look and feel of aniPhone was great. The question for the jury was did thevery small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makeslook substantially similar to the very small portion ofthe patent claim?Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis inthis record for a conclusion that the entire product,profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profitfrom those articles. What Apple should have done isdone either of the two things we discussed earlier,accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goodssold on the components, or it should have done consumersurvey evidence like our expert did.1\",\n",

Congress said you can'tapportion the value of the design in relation to thearticle. We're conceding that here. What Congress did53not say is you can't segregate the proper article fromthe other articles that make up the product. So we cansegregate article from other articles within theproduct. And, in fact, Section89 requires us to dothat because it allows total profit only from thatarticle of manufacture to which the design has applied.Now, the test that we ask the Court toannounce on remand. As has been discussed, it has twoparts.The first is -- the antecedent question isidentify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimesthat will be very easy if you do it from two mainfactors. What does the patent scope claim, a frontface, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing?And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for theinstruction, you allude to it, blue brief1, weactually asked the jury to be told that where thearticle of manufacture is a case or external housing,that's the article of manufacture.The second question is quantum of profits.And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in sayingthat a lot of the expert determinations about how muchdid the Beetle exterior drive demand will come intoplay, as the government said and we agree, only at thesecond question: What is the quantum of profits fromthe right article of manufacture?54But, Justice Alito, you asked how similarare we to the government's test? And, Justice Kennedy,you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistencyamong juries.We think the answer to the first questioncan be made more consistent and uniform if we focusmainly on two factors: What does the design in thepatent claim: front face, exterior casing holding thefront face? And second, what is the product to which ithas been applied? That will help judges to guidejuries.We think we should have had instruction42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summaryjudgment that the article of manufacture is the frontface, and that could be instructed to the jury\",\n",
